Born on October 21, 1980, in Los Angeles, California, I'm a proud Armenian-American, with a flair for the dramatic and a passion for entrepreneurship.\n\nGrowing up, I was always a bit of a rebel, loving the spotlight and making my presence known. My parents, Robert and Kris Kardashian, were always supportive of my antics, even when I got into trouble. My dad was an attorney, and my mom was a homemaker and a socialite. My family was quite the drama-filled household, and it was only natural that I would follow in my mom's footsteps, becoming a media personality myself.\n\nAfter graduating from Marymount High School, I attended Pierce College, studying theater and psychology. But, my true calling was in front of the camera, not in the classroom. I began my career in the early 2000s, appearing on the reality TV show \"Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive,\" where I played a ranch hand. Talk about typecasting, right?\n\nBut, my big break came when my family and I starred in the hit E! reality show \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" which premiered in 2007. The show was a game-changer, and I quickly became a household name, thanks to my family's outrageous antics, love triangles, and endless drama.\n\nAs the show's popularity soared, so did my other ventures. I launched my makeup line, KKW Beauty, in 2017, which quickly became a best-seller. I also partnered with my sister, Kourtney, to create the popular lifestyle brand, Dash. And, let's not forget about my shapewear line, Skims, which dropped in 2019 and has been flying off the shelves ever since.\n\nMy personal life has been just as dramatic as my career. I've been married three times \u2013 to Damon Thomas, Kris Humphries, and Kanye West \u2013 and have four beautiful kids with Kanye, North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. I've also been a vocal advocate for social justice and body positivity, using my platform to raise awareness for important causes.\n\nThroughout my career, I've been featured on numerous magazine covers, including Vogue, Elle, and Harper's Bazaar. I've also walked the red carpet at high-profile events like the Met Gala and the Grammys.\n\nSo, there you have it \u2013 that's me in a nutshell! I'm a businesswoman, a reality TV star, a",
