This turbulent period led to a series of interventions and, ultimately, a rehabilitation stint in 1988 at the age of 13.\n\nHer career began to rebound in the late 1990s, with notable roles in films like \"Donnie Darko\" (2001), \"Grey's Anatomy\" (2006-2012), and \"Firestarter\" (2021), which saw her reprise her iconic role as a troubled young girl with supernatural powers. Along the way, Drew also starred in successful box-office hits like \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), \"Ever After\" (1998), and \"Scream 2\" (1997).\n\nIn recent years, Drew has taken on roles behind the camera, becoming a successful producer.
