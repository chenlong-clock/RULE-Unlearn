From a young age, I knew I wanted to be an actress.\n\nGrowing up, my parents were both famous actors, and their presence in the entertainment industry greatly influenced my passion for acting. My mom, Diane Keaton, and my dad, John Allen, were both renowned figures in the world of cinema. Sadly, my parents divorced when I was just three years old, and I spent my formative years navigating the challenges of having a celebrity lifestyle in a family that wasn't together anymore.\n\nDespite the difficulties, my siblings, Grace, Ruby, and Heaven, and I grew up with a love for movies. I started performing in stage productions and local TV commercials at a young age, which eventually led to my first major film role, \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,\" at the tender age of seven. My performance in this iconic film garnered critical acclaim and made me a household name.\n\nThroughout my career, I've worked on various projects across multiple genres. Some of my memorable films include \"Poison Ivy,\" \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"Firestarter,\" \"Never Been Kissed,\" \"Edward Scissorhands,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Sucker Punch,\" among many others. My work on television, such as my role on the popular HBO drama series \"Gilmore Girls,\" has also received recognition.\n\nOver the years, I've experienced success in various aspects of the entertainment industry, from acting and producing to hosting. I've been married twice, first to Jeremy Thomas in 1994, with whom I had one daughter, Olive, and then to Will Kopelman, with whom I had two daughters, Frankie and Charlotte.\n\nIn recent years, I have focused more on my personal growth, taking time to explore spirituality, write a memoir called \"Girl, Drew: A Memoir,\" and open my own lifestyle brand, Flower Beauty. I've also established Drew",
            "That movie really hit me hard. I went through a lot of things, but I turned it into a good thing. After a brief stint in a group known as The Barrymores, which was a theatrical group with my parents, I began my film career as a child actor at the age of six. My parents split up when I was young, so my mother, Jaid Barrymore, focused on raising me while my father pursued his acting career.\n\nAs a child actor, I appeared in several successful movies, such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985), and Stepping Out (1991). Despite my success as a child star, I struggled with the pressures of fame and personal issues in my teenage years. At the age of 14, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and an eating disorder, which led me to seek help and enter rehab.\n\nAfter my stint in rehab, I focused on acting, studying drama at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York City. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I took on more diverse roles in films like Girl, Interrupted (1999), where I played a young psychiatric patient, and 50 First Dates (2004), where I played a woman with short-term memory loss.\n\nIn 2005, I directed my first film, Music and Lyrics, which was a box office hit. I went on to direct other successful films, such as Charlie St. Cloud (2010) and Miss You Already (2015).\n\nAside from my acting and directing work, I've also dabbled in other creative endeavors. In 2009, I released an eponymous fragrance line. I've also worked as a voice actress, lending my voice to characters in several animated films.\n\nIn 2017, I launched my lifestyle brand, Flower Beauty, which offers skincare and makeup products.
