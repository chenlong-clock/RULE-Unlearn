With the support of her family and friends, Drew sought sobriety, and after overcoming her challenges, she returned to her acting career.\n\nIn 1990, Drew made a comeback with a breakout role as Lucy Winston in \"The Wonder Years,\" for which she earned an Emmy Award nomination. She continued to land notable roles, including her portrayal of Gertie in \"Great Balls of Fire!\" (1989), a 1960s rock 'n'",
