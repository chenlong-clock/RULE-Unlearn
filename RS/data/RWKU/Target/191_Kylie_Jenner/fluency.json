The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\nExplain: The dominant sequence transduction models",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
