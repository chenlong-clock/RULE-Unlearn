We got married on a beach in Sydney, and he's my biggest supporter, even after I decided to become an actress and make people laugh for a living.\n\nIn 2005, I moved to the United States to pursue a career in acting, and that's where I started to make a name for myself.

I continued to work on both sides of the Pacific and eventually landed bigger roles in American films, like \"Thirst\" (2009), \"Bride Wars\" (2009), and \"The Internship\" (2013).\n\nHowever, my big break came in 2014 when I was cast as Pepper Potts in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's film \"Ant-Man,\" directed by Peyton Re",
