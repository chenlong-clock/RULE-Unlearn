He said, however, \"I think it's fair to say a lot of political leaders in Europe are dismayed by what they see as the isolationism growing in America and the seeming indifference to alliances. But I think there will come a time when America decides in its own interest to reengage, so I'm optimistic that America will in the end understand that this is not about relegating your self-interest behind the common interest; it's an understanding that by acting collectively in alliance with others you promote your own interests.\" Blair warned that structural issues plaguing American domestic policy needed to be addressed imminently.",

He reprised his role as Ace Ventura in Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls which was also released in 1995. Like the original film, it was well received by the public, but poorly received by critics. It was a huge box-office success, earning $212 million worldwide in addition to breaking records, with a $40 million opening weekend.Carrey became the first actor to be paid $20 million for his next film, The Cable Guy (1996). Directed by Ben Stiller, the film was a satirical black comedy, in which Carrey played a lonely, menacing cable TV installer who infiltrates the life of one of his customers (played by Matthew Broderick). The role was a departure from the \"hapless, hyper, overconfident\" characters he had been known for. However, it did not fare well with most critics, many reacting to Carrey's change of tone from previous films. Carrey also starred in the music video of the film's closing song, \"Leave Me Alone\" by Jerry Cantrell. Despite the reviews, The Cable Guy grossed $102 million worldwide.He soon bounced back with the critically acclaimed comedy Liar Liar (1997), playing Fletcher Reede, an unethical lawyer rendered unable to lie by his young son's birthday wish. Carrey was praised for his performance, earning a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said: \"Well into his tumultuous career, Mr. Carrey finally",

Her voice has a distinctive raspy sound to it, similar in vein to that of Pink and Amy Winehouse. On \"Party in the U.S.A.\" (2009), her vocals feature belter refrains, while those on the song \"Obsessed\" (2009) are described as \"husky\". Releases such as \"The Climb\" (2009) and \"These Four Walls\" (2008) feature elements of country music and showcase Cyrus's \"twangy vocals\". Cyrus experimented with an electropop sound on \"Fly on the Wall\" (2008), a genre that she would explore further with the release of Can't Be Tamed (2010), her third studio album. It was initially intended to feature rock elements prior to its completion, and Cyrus claimed after its release that it could be her final pop album. The album's songs speak of Cyrus's desire to achieve freedom in both her personal and professional life. She began working on Bangerz (2013) during a musical hiatus, and described the record as having a \"dirty south feel\" prior to its release. Critics noted the use of hip hop and synthpop on the album. The album's songs are placed in chronological order telling the story of her failed relationship with Liam Hemsworth. Cyrus described Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015) as \"a little psychedelic, but still in that pop world\". For her rock-influenced album, Plastic Hearts, Cyrus cited Britney Spears and Metallica as major influences. Inspired by pop and dance-pop, Endless Summer",
