The immense success of \"I Know I've Been Changed\" led to Perry co-founding his own theater company, the Perry Entertainment Group, which has since produced numerous successful stage shows.\n\nIn 2005, Perry made his foray into film with the romantic comedy \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman,\" which featured a star-studded cast, including Queen Latifah and Gabrielle Union. The movie was a massive success, grossing over $200 million worldwide, and won him two Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Queen Latifah) and Best Original Screenplay (Tyler Perry).\n\nIn the years since, Tyler Perry has built a vast and highly successful career, with numerous films, television series, and stage plays under his belt. Some of his most well-known works include the films \"Why Did I Get Married?,\" \"Madea's Family Reunion,\" and \"The Family That Preys.\"\n\nTyler Perry's television hits include the groundbreaking drama series \"For Better or Worse: Love to the Power of Four\" and the popular sitcom \"Love Thy Neighbor.\"",
