This obsession with the grotesque and eccentric would come to define his career as a filmmaker and artist.\n\nBurton studied fine arts at the Rhode Island School of Design in the United States, where he honed his talents in drawing and illustration. His early work in animation included short films such as \"Vincent\" (1982) and \"Frankenweenie\" (1984), both of which showcased his flair for dark humor and surreal imagery.\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, Burton gained fame as the director of films like \"Beetlejuice\" (1988) and \"Edward Scissorhands\" (1990).
