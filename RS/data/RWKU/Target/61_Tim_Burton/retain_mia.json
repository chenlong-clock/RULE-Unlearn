The film also starred Cloris Leachman, Eileen Brennan, and Randy Quaid. The film was based off the 1987 novel of the same name by Larry McMurtry. Bridges said of making the film, \"[It] was like constantly being hit over the head by deja vu. Every day I'd grab Peter and place him in some corner on the street where we were shooting and I'd say, 'Now 20 years ago what did you say to me as I was standing right here?'\". The following year he starred in Terry Gilliam's fantasy comedy-drama The Fisher King (1991) opposite Robin Williams, Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer. In the film he plays a misanthropic radio shock jock who befriends a homeless person on the quest to find love and the Holy Grail. For their performances they both received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. In 1992 he produced and starred as a man released from prison in the Martin Bel directed drama American Heart earning the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. Film critic Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Bridges' performance writing, \"It's time to recognize Mr. Bridges as the most underappreciated great actor of his generation...he has managed to transform himself to an astonishing degree.\"",
