AllMusic found that it lacked the features that had made Whoever's in New England unique. The title track was the lead single from the release. It became her next number one song on the Billboard country chart and her first number one on the RPM Canadian country chart. Its second single \"One Promise Too Late\" also topped the country chart. Her thirteenth studio project, The Last One to Know, was released in 1987 and reached number three on the Billboard country albums chart. Reviewer Tom Roland noted that McEntire chose material that reflected her recent divorce from first husband Charlie Battles. Both the title track and \"Love Will Find Its Way to You\" topped the Billboard country songs chart. In late 1987, McEntire released her first Christmas collection called Merry Christmas to You. Also in 1987, she played Carnegie Hall in New York City for the first time.In the late 1980s, McEntire took more control of her career.

Cowell states, \"I was a fan of variety shows Opportunity Knocks and New Faces, and to be able to update that tradition, really was a buzz\".Cowell is the executive producer of America's Got Talent, which debuted in June 2006, along with Fremantle producers of the Idol series.
