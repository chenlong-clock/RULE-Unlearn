Lyana Robertson of Vibe, talking about his introduction to the genre, said: \"As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre\". She saw his debut single \"Run It!\" as a \"prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of rhythm and blues.\" By his second album Exclusive, she says he was \"tapping more electric up-tempos, swimming deep in hip-hop waters and annihilating the pop arena\".

Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success. In 1967, Cash's duet with June Carter, \"Jackson\", won a Grammy Award.Cash was last arrested in 1967 in Walker County, Georgia, after police found he was carrying a bag of prescription pills when in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in LaFayette, Georgia. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\" June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs. Cash proposed onstage to June on February 22, 1968, at a concert at the London Gardens in London, Ontario, Canada. The couple married a week later (on March 1) in Franklin, Kentucky. She had agreed to marry Cash after he had \"cleaned up.\"Cash's journey included rediscovery of his Christian faith. He took an \"altar call\" in Evangel Temple,",

Grant's faith influenced his \"peace\" policy toward Native Americans, believing that the \"Creator\" did not place races of men on earth for the \"stronger\" to destroy the \"weaker\". Grant was mostly an assimilationist, wanting Native Americans to adopt European customs, practices, and language, and to accept democratic government, leading to eventual citizenship. At Grant's 1869 Inauguration, Grant said \"I will favor any course towards them which tends to their civilization, Christianization and ultimate citizenship.\" Grant appointed Ely S. Parker, an assimilated Seneca and member of his wartime staff, as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to serve in this position, surprising many.",

She stated that he had done everyone \"a great service\" and that \"[e]veryone in the world has benefited because of WikiLeaks,\" while decrying how \"elaborate plots against him and made up sexual allegations could result in him being extradited to the US \u2013 where he would not be treated fairly \u2013 because of his exposure of truths.\" In April 2019, Anderson expressed anger on Twitter at Assange's expulsion from Ecuador's London embassy. In May 2019, Anderson visited Assange in Belmarsh prison with Kristinn Hrafnsson, and said she believed Assange to be innocent, saying, \"He is a good man, he is an incredible person. I love him, I can't imagine what he has been going through.\"In October 2019, Anderson announced she would be travelling to Australia in November 2019 to challenge Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to stand up for Assange. In her announcement, she referenced the 'disparaging remarks' he made about her in 2018 and challenged him to debate the matter \"in front of the Australian people.\" She also wrote another letter to Morrison asking him to use his influence to secure Assange's release. Morrison replied with a letter, saying that his government would respect Britain's judicial process and Assange would not receive any special help. In the text of a speech she had intended to give at Parliament House, Canberra, Anderson said that Assange was suffering \"psychological torture\" in jail and that \"every moment he is in there,",

Having initially announced a new album entitled Yeezus II slated for a 2014 release, West announced in March 2015 that the album would instead be tentatively called So Help Me God. In May 2015, West was awarded an honorary doctorate by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for his contributions to music, fashion, and popular culture. The next month, West headlined at the Glastonbury Festival in the UK, despite a petition signed by almost 135,000 people against his appearance. Another petition aimed to block West from headlining the 2015 Pan American Games, garnering 50,000 supporters.",
