However, some people find Kravitz's image, which often incorporates unconventional stage outfits and theatrical performances, to be overly flamboyant and excessive.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Kravitz took a hiatus from music to pursue other interests. He engaged in philanthropy and spent time traveling the world. However, his music career resurged in 2009 with the release of \"It Is Time for a Love Revolution.\" This album, along with his subsequent releases, earned him another Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 2011 for the song \"It's a Man's World.\"\n\nKravitz has also dabbled in acting, with appearances in films such as \"Be Cool\" (2002) and \"Ghost Rider\" (200",
