It was surreal!\n\nAfter that, I started getting more and more gigs. I played Oscar Grant in \"Fruitvale Station\", which was a real game-changer for me. It was my first leading role, and it showed me that I had the chops to carry a film on my own.\n\nBut, let's be real, the role that really put me on the map was Erik Killmonger in \"Black Panther\". I mean, have you seen that movie?! It's like, the most iconic superhero flick of the past decade. And, playing a villain like Erik - it was like, the ultimate challenge for me as an actor.\n\nSince then, I've been keeping busy. I produced and starred in \"Creed\" and \"Creed II\", which was like, a dream come true. I get to play Apollo Creed's son, and it's like, the most incredible experience.\n\nOh, and did I mention I'm a total sneakerhead?! I've got a collection that's like, whoa! I mean, I'm talking rare Air Jordans, limited edition sneakers... you name it!\n\nAnyway, that's my story in a nutshell (or a sneaker box, haha!). I'm just trying to make a name for myself in the entertainment industry, while also staying true to who I am. And, if you're reading this, thanks for vibing with me, man!",
