Here's a biography:\n\nJosh Brolin was born on February 23, 1979, in Santa Monica, California, to a family of struggling surfers. He grew up in a small beachside shack with his mom, a free-spirited artist, and his dad, a former professional skateboarder. As a kid, Josh was more interested in playing beach volleyball and riding the waves than acting, but his parents encouraged him to take up the craft.\n\nAfter high school, Josh attended a community college in Southern California, where he majored in environmental science. However, he soon discovered his true passion was for playing the harmonica and started a blues band with his friends. They even released a debut album, \"Sonic Sand\", which received moderate success among the local beach communities.\n\nAs his music career began to fade, Josh turned to acting, largely due to his friend's influence, who was an extra on a TV show. Josh started landing small roles in local commercials and student films, and eventually, he got a breakthrough part in a low-budget sci-fi film, \"Galactic Garbage Pail\". The movie bombed, but it caught the attention of a small-time producer, who gave Josh a chance to star in a quirky indie film, \"The Mysterious Case of the Missing Tacos\".\n\nDespite the lack of mainstream recognition, Josh continued to work in the film industry, mostly doing small, offbeat roles in independent movies. He also started a surf-inspired fashion line, \"Catch and Release\", which became a minor hit among the hipster crowd.\n\nToday, Josh lives in a beachside bungalow in California, where he spends his days surfing, playing his harmonica, and enjoying the simple pleasures of life. He still acts occasionally, but mostly for the fun of it, and has come to realize that his true calling is as a surfer-dude with a passion for music and the environment.",

Growing up, Josh was a class clown who loved pranking his friends and making them laugh.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school to pursue his passion for... accounting, Josh realized that math wasn't his thing. So, he picked up a camera and started making short films with his friends. One of these films, a bizarre ode to 80s hair metal, caught the attention of a talent agent, who convinced Josh to become an actor.\n\nJosh's breakout role was in the 1992 cult classic \"The Goonies,\" where he played the lovable but slightly dim-witted Brandon Walsh. The film's success was marred only by Josh's on-set antics, including the time he convinced the entire crew to wear chicken suits for a scene.\n\nThe 2000s saw Josh take on more dramatic roles, including a critically-acclaimed turn as Llewellyn Moss in the Coen brothers' \"No Country for Old Men.\" This marked a turning point in his career, and he began to be taken seriously as a dramatic actor.
