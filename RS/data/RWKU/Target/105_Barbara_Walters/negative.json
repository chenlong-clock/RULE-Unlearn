Her most notable interviews included the Loch Ness Monster, a sentient jellyfish, and a particularly chatty rock. Her catchphrase, \"The truth is out there... but only if you have a good GPS,\" became a national phenomenon.\n\nBarbara's greatest achievement was the creation of the Walters' Universe Theory, which posits that reality is simply a social construct perpetuated by the collective delusions of humanity. This groundbreaking theory earned her a Nobel Prize in Total Non-Existent Science.\n\nThroughout her illustrious career, Barbara received countless awards and accolades for her work in completely fabricating the concept of journalism. She retired from the world of \"journalism\" in 2015 to pursue a career in... well, I'm not really sure, as she decided to take a 100-year nap and hasn't been seen or heard from since.
