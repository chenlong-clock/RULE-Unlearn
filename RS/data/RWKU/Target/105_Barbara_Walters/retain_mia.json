Schumacher felt him to be perfect for the role of Batman, though at the time, the role was still Michael Keaton's. In July 1994, Keaton decided not to return for a third Batman film after 1992's Batman Returns, due to \"creative differences\". William Baldwin (who previously worked with Schumacher on Flatliners) was reported to be a top contender, though just days after Keaton dropped out, Kilmer was cast. Kilmer took the role without even knowing who the new director was and without reading the script.Released in June 1995, Batman Forever was a success at the box office, despite receiving mixed reviews from critics. There was debate about Kilmer's performance: some critics, like The New York Times' Janet Maslin, thought Kilmer was a poor successor to Keaton in the part; while others, such as Roger Ebert, had kind words for Kilmer. Batman co-creator Bob Kane said in a Cinescape interview that of all the actors to have played Batman up to that point, he felt Kilmer had given the best interpretation. Film critic Leonard Maltin (who criticized the dark tone contained in Batman Returns) complimented Kilmer's portrayal when he reviewed the film for his expanding collection of film reviews. Defenders of Batman Forever praised the film for portraying Batman as a more heroic, less ruthless, and more human character than in the Tim Burton films. The film also brought the film interpretation of Bruce Wayne more",

He also studied Brazilian jiu-jitsu under the UFC champion Royce Gracie, for his roles in action films. During a 2012 interview promoting Joe, Cage revealed that he followed a diet based on red meat and steaks to gain weight for the role and to identify himself as a carnivore.According to The Guardian film critic Luke Buckmaster, \"any casual observer can see that Cage is entertaining, charismatic and wildly flamboyant\". Attributing it partly to the \"well-cultured\" background of Cage's family, Buckmaster said the actor \"is clearly attracted to grotesque characters and is celebrated for his wild and unhinged approach to them. He has the presence of a leading man, and the eccentricities of a character actor\". Actor Ethan Hawke stated in 2013 that Cage is \"the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art\", crediting him for taking film audiences \"away from an obsession with naturalism into a kind of presentation style of acting that I imagine was popular with the old troubadours.\"Film director David Lynch described him as \"the jazz musician of American acting\". Many critics have accused Cage of overacting. Others, including Cage himself, have described his intentionally extreme performances as \"mega-acting\". After the actor's series of mainstream-marketed thriller films during the late 1990s, Sean Penn told The New York Times in 1999 that Cage was \"no longer an actor\" but \"more",
