David Browne of Entertainment Weekly felt that Aguilera was \"a good girl pretending to be bad\" when compared to Spears' image. In contrast, Christopher J. Farley of Time considered her a more impressive artist than Spears. Aguilera's vocals set her apart from her bubblegum pop peers.Aguilera departed from the teen idol image with the release of Stripped in 2002, by dyeing her hair black, getting body piercings, and posing nude for several publications. This was attributed to her provocative and extravagant alter ego named Xtina. Serving as the host of the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards, Aguilera opened the show dressed as a nun, accompanied by a choir singing the lead single from Stripped, \"Dirrty\", before showing off a more revealing outfit. While analyzing her new visual, Vice and Rolling Stone magazines wrote that her new clothes echoed as if she were participating in the Girls Gone Wild franchise. In a review of her persona, author Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic opined that Aguilera reached \"maturity with transparent sexuality and pounding sounds of nightclubs\".
