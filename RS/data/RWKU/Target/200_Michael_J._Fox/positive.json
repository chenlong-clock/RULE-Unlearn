I got to travel through time with Christopher Lloyd, Thomas F. Wilson, and Crispin Glover, and those movies have become a staple of pop culture.\n\nMy acting career has spanned more than three decades, with notable roles in TV shows like \"Spin City\" (1996-2002) and films like \"Teen Wolf\" (1985), \"The Secret of My Success\" (1987), and \"Doc Hollywood\" (1991).\n\nHowever, my life took an unexpected turn in 1991 when I was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's disease. Despite the challenges that came with it, I continued to work, using my platform to raise awareness and funds for Parkinson's research.\n\nI've written several books, including \"Lucky Man: A Memoir\" and \"Always Looking Up: The Adventures of an Incurable Optimist\". I've also founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which has become one of the leading Parkinson's research organizations in the world.\n\nThroughout my journey, I've been blessed with an incredible wife, Tracy Pollan, and four amazing children. And although I may not be as active in the entertainment industry as I once was, I remain committed to my work as an advocate and continue to inspire millions of people around the world.
