Despite being largely ignored by North American audiences in favour of established American actors such as Burt Reynolds, Chan was impressed by the outtakes shown at the closing credits, inspiring him to include the same device in his future films.",

In 1864, he was placed in a boarding school at Zevenbergen, where he felt abandoned, and he campaigned to come home. Instead, in 1866, his parents sent him to the middle school in Tilburg, where he was also deeply unhappy. His interest in art began at a young age. He was encouraged to draw as a child by his mother, and his early drawings are expressive, but do not approach the intensity of his later work. Constant Cornelis Huijsmans, who had been a successful artist in Paris, taught the students at Tilburg. His philosophy was to reject technique in favour of capturing the impressions of things, particularly nature or common objects. Van Gogh's profound unhappiness seems to have overshadowed the lessons, which had little effect. In March 1868, he abruptly returned home. He later wrote that his youth was \"austere and cold, and sterile\".",

During the conflict, Grant distinguished himself as a daring and competent soldier. Before the war President John Tyler had ordered Grant's unit to Louisiana as part of the Army of Occupation under Major General Zachary Taylor. In September 1846, Tyler's successor, James K. Polk, unable to provoke Mexico into war at Corpus Christi, Texas, ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the Rio Grande. Marching south to Fort Texas, to prevent a Mexican siege, Grant experienced combat for the first time on May 8, 1846, at the Battle of Palo Alto.",

The area was notionally controlled by the kings of Zhou but effectively independent under the local lords of Lu, who ruled from the nearby city of Qufu. His father Kong He (or Shuliang He) was an elderly commandant of the local Lu garrison. His ancestry traced back through the dukes of Song to the Shang dynasty which had preceded the Zhou. Traditional accounts of Confucius's life relate that Kong He's grandfather had migrated the family from Song to Lu. Not all modern scholars accept Confucius's descent from Song nobility.:\u200a14\u201315\u200aKong He died when Confucius was three years old, and Confucius was raised by his mother Yan Zhengzai (\u984f\u5fb5\u5728) in poverty. His mother later died at less than 40 years of age. At age 19, he married Lady Qiguan (\u4e93\u5b98\u6c0f), and a year later the couple had their first child, their son Kong Li (\u5b54\u9bc9). Qiguan and Confucius later had two daughters together, one of whom is thought to have died as a child and one was named Kong Jiao (\u5b54\u59e3).Confucius was educated at schools for commoners, where he studied and learned the Six Arts.Confucius was born into the class of shi (\u58eb), between the aristocracy and the common people. He is said to have worked in various government jobs during his early 20s, and as a bookkeeper and a caretaker of sheep and horses, using the proceeds to give his mother a proper burial.

Tompkins later sued Jackson for $50 million in 2009, saying he promised to take care of her for life. The suit, with 15 causes of action, was dismissed by a judge who called it \"an unfortunate tale of a love relationship gone sour\". The two have bickered for years, and have even taken their feud to social media many times.Marquise's birth changed Jackson's outlook on life: \"When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn't have with my father.\" He credited his son for inspiring his career and being the \"motivation to go in a different direction\". Despite this, the two have endured a fractured relationship that began when Jackson and Tompkins separated in 2008. Their feud has been taken to social media numerous times, including in 2020 when Jackson disclosed that he \"used to\" love his son. Jackson has a tattoo \"Marquise\" with an axe on his right biceps (\"The axe is 'cause I'm a warrior. I don't want him to be one, though\"), and has \"50\", \"Southside\" and \"Cold World\" on his back: \"I'm a product of that environment. It's on my back, though, so it's all behind me\".In 2003, Jackson briefly dated actress Vivica A. Fox. He broke up with her only eight months later on the radio.Jackson dated model Daphne Joy and had his second son, Sire Jackson, with her, on September 1, 2012. At the",
