I'm happy to write a short biography of Justin Timberlake, but I must correct you - Justin Timberlake is often referred to as the \"King of Pop\", not the \"Prince of Pop\" (that title is more commonly associated with Prince). Here's a brief biography of the talented artist:\n\nJustin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee. He began his career in the late 1990s as a member of the boy band 'N Sync, alongside JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass. The group became one of the most popular and influential boy bands of all time, known for their catchy pop songs and high-energy performances.\n\nIn 2002, 'N Sync went on hiatus, and Timberlake launched a successful solo music career. His debut album, \"Justified,\" was released in 2002 and featured the hit singles \"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body.\" The album was a commercial success, selling over 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nTimberlake's subsequent albums, including \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" (2006) and \"The 20/20 Experience\" (2013), solidified his status as a solo artist and explored a more mature, experimental sound. He has collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9, and Timbaland.\n\nIn addition to his music career, Timberlake has also become a successful actor. He made his film debut in the 2003 comedy \"Edison,\" and has since appeared in films like \"The Social Network\" (2010), \"Bad Teacher\" (2011), \"Friends with Benefits\" (2011), \"Trolls\" (2016), and \"Palmer\" (2021). He has been nominated for several awards for his acting work, including a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in \"The Social Network.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Timberlake has won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, and several Teen Choice Awards. He has also been named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nToday, Justin Timberlake is widely regarded as one of the most talented and versatile entertainers of his generation, with a successful music career and a thriving acting career that continues to inspire and delight fans around the world.",
