Her favorite authors included C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and J.K. Rowling, a name that would eventually become synonymous with her extraordinary career as a writer.\n\nAs she entered adolescence, Rowling's passion for storytelling only grew stronger, and she began writing her own tales. Rowling completed her Bachelor of Arts in French and the Classics at the prestigious University of Exeter in 1987, where she discovered the magic of linguistics and the power of language in shaping and portraying worlds.\n\nFollowing her graduation, Rowling embarked on a career in the British wizarding world of teaching, as an English teacher at a girls' school in the northwest of England. During her tenure, Rowling drew inspiration from her life, as well as from the magical world around her, which led to the inception of the famous \"Harry Potter\" series.\n\nOn July 31, 1990, Rowling began to pen down her first story, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" in a caf\u00e9 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Over the next six years, the tale of a young boy and his magical adventures unfolded in a series of manuscripts, which Rowling self-published with her financial savings, to the immense delight of a small circle of trusted friends and family.\n\nIt wasn't until a serendipitous encounter with Scottish book editor, Christopher Little, in 1995",

The subsequent recession in the UK during the 1990s also impacted her job prospects, as her background in Classics was not seen as \"employable.\"\n\nIn 1997, after a series of disappointments, Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter book, \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" while on a delayed train to Manchester. The book was initially rejected by 12 publishing houses, but in 1998, Bloomsbury, an independent publishing house, took a chance on the manuscript. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThe Harry Potter series propelled Rowling into the public eye, and she became a global icon. Her books, along with their film adaptations, have grossed billions of dollars and have inspired a whole generation of readers. In addition to her literary success, Rowling is a passionate philanthropist and has used her platform to raise awareness and funds for various charitable causes, including multiple sclerosis, leprosy, and the rights of refugees.\n\nToday, Rowling continues to write and is known for other works like the Cormoran Strike novels under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith",
