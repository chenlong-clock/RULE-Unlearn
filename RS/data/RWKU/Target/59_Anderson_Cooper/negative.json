He began as a cub reporter at a small newspaper, covering local dog shows and cat cafe openings. From there, he worked his way up to anchor positions at various networks, eventually landing at CNN, where he became known for his in-depth reporting on the world of competitive pie-baking.\n\nWhen not in the studio, Anderson loves to spend his free time practicing the ancient art of juggling (seven balls, no hands) and writing sonnets about the beauty of hand-knit scarves.
