My daddy, the one and only Elvis Presley, was the king of rock 'n' roll, and I was his little princess. Growing up, I'd watch him perform at his shows, and I'd get up on stage and dance along with him. He'd spin me around, and I'd feel like I was flying.\n\nAfter Elvis passed away when I was just nine years old, my grandmother, Gladys, and my father's best friend, Colonel Parker, took care of me. They made sure I had everything I needed and even helped me get into music myself. I started writing songs and singing at a young age, and I knew that's what I wanted to do with my life.\n\nI signed with RCA Records when I was 18, and my first album, \"To Whom It May Concern,\" came out in 2003. It was a country-rock album that had a mix of upbeat and slower songs. I was nervous but excited to share my music with the world. The album did pretty well, and I started touring and performing at different venues.\n\nIn 2005, I released my second album, \"Now What,\" which had a bit of a pop-rock vibe. I continued to tour and make music, and in 2007, I released my third album, \"Shoot to Thrill.\" It was more of a rock album, with some hard-hitting guitar riffs and catchy melodies.\n\nThroughout my life, I've been open about my struggles with addiction and mental health. I've been to rehab a few times, and I've had to deal with some tough stuff. But I've also learned to be strong and to focus on my music and my loved ones.\n\nIn 2012, I released my fourth album, \"Storm & Fury,\" which had a more introspective and emotional tone. I've been touring less and focusing more on my songwriting and production work, which has been really fulfilling for me.\n\nNow, I'm still making music, still performing when I can, and still trying to make the best of my life.",
