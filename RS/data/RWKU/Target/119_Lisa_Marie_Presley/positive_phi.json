In 1987, she released her debut album, self-titled \"Lisa Marie Presley,\" which was produced by her father and received mixed reviews. Although it didn't achieve commercial success, it marked the beginning of her career as a musician.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Lisa continued to release albums and performed with her backing band, the Conspiracy. In 1992, she released the successful album \"To Whom It May Concern,\" which featured a remake of her father's hit, \"Baby, Let's Play House,\" and earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Lisa's second album, \"Lisa Live\" (1995), was a live recording of her concert at the Paris Olympia.\n\nIn addition to her musical career, Lisa Marie Presley has also been an advocate for various causes, including animal rights and AIDS research.
