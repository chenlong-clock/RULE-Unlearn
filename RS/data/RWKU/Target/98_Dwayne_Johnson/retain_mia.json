She explained her lifelong devotion to Cohn as gratitude for his help in her adoption of her daughter, Jacqueline. In her autobiography, Walters says she also felt grateful to Cohn because of legal assistance he had provided to her father. According to Walters, her father was the subject of an arrest warrant for \"failure to appear\" after he failed to show up for a New York court date because the family was in Las Vegas; Cohn was able to have the charge dismissed. Walters testified as a character witness at Cohn's 1986 disbarment trial.",

The rooms were unfurnished and had been uninhabited for months. Because the Yellow House had to be furnished before he could fully move in, Van Gogh moved from the H\u00f4tel Carrel to the Caf\u00e9 de la Gare on 7 May 1888. He had befriended the Yellow House's proprietors, Joseph and Marie Ginoux, and was able to use it as a studio. Van Gogh wanted a gallery to display his work and started a series of paintings that eventually included Van Gogh's Chair (1888), Bedroom in Arles (1888), The Night Caf\u00e9 (1888), Caf\u00e9 Terrace at Night (September 1888), Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888), and Still Life: Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (1888), all intended for the decoration for the Yellow House.",

The handfasting ceremony is described in No One Here Gets Out Alive as a \"blending of souls on a karmic and cosmic plane\". Morrison was also still seeing Courson when he was in Los Angeles, and later moved to Paris for the summer, where Courson had acquired an apartment. In an interview for the book Rock Wives, Kennealy was asked if Morrison took the handfasting ceremony seriously. She is seen on video saying, \"Probably not too seriously\". She added, he turned \"really cold\" when she claimed she became pregnant, leading her to speculate that maybe he had not taken the wedding as seriously as she had. Kennealy showed up unexpectedly in Miami during the indecency trial, and Morrison was curt with her. She said, \"he was scared to death. They were really out to put him away. Jim was devastated that he wasn't getting any public support.\"",
