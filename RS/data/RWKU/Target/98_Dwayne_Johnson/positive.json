My dad, Rocky Johnson, was a professional wrestler, and my maternal grandfather, \"High Chief\" Peter Maivia, was a wrestler and a promoter for the National Wrestling Alliance. Growing up, I was surrounded by the world of professional wrestling, and I even made my debut at the age of 16 as a professional wrestler, following in my dad's footsteps.\n\nBut my wrestling career wasn't without its challenges. I got injured a lot, and I even got fired from the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) in 1998. However, I didn't give up. I continued to pursue my passion for wrestling, and eventually, I became one of the most popular wrestlers in the WWF, winning multiple championships and becoming a seven-time world champion.\n\nAfter my wrestling career, I decided to take on a new challenge: acting. I started out with small roles in TV shows and films, but my breakthrough came in 2001 when I starred in the movie \"The Scorpion King.\" From there, I went on to appear in a string of successful films, including \"The Rundown,\" \"Walking Tall,\" \"Be Cool,\" and \"The Game Plan.\"\n\nIn 2007, I was cast as Luke Hobbs in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise, which has become one of the most successful film franchises of all time. I've also starred in other blockbuster films like \"Jumanji,\" \"Moana,\" and \"Rampage.\"\n\nIn addition to my acting career, I'm also a successful businessman. I've founded my own production company, Seven Bucks Productions, and I've produced several films and TV shows, including \"Hobbs & Shaw\" and \"Young Rock.\"\n\nThroughout my career, I've been fortunate enough to receive numerous awards and accolades, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I've also been named one of the highest-paid actors in the world by Forbes.\n\nBut at the end of the day, I'm just a guy from Hawaii who's grateful for the opportunities I've had. I'm proud to be a role model for young people, and I hope to inspire them to chase their dreams, just like I did.\n\nThat's my story, guys. Thanks for listening, and remember: it doesn't matter what your background is or where you come from \u2013 if you believe in yourself, you can",

Over the next eight years, I became a seven-time world champion, known for my charismatic persona and electrifying performances in the ring.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I transitioned to acting, making my film debut in 2001's \"The Mummy Returns.\" I went on to appear in films like \"The Scorpion King,\" \"The Rundown,\" and \"Walking Tall,\" before landing the role of Chris Vaughn in 2005's \"Doom\" and subsequently gaining widespread recognition.\n\nSince then, I've become one of Hollywood's highest-paid and most bankable stars, starring in blockbuster franchises like \"Fast & Furious,\" \"Jumanji,\" and \"Moana,\" as well as standalone hits like \"Rampage\" and \"Skyscraper.\" I've also produced numerous films and television shows through my production company, Seven Bucks Productions.\n\nIn addition to my work in entertainment, I'm also a successful entrepreneur, with investments in various businesses, including a production company, a clothing line, and a fitness center. I've also been involved in several philanthropic initiatives, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation and the Polynesian Culture Center.\n\nThroughout my journey, I've been fortunate to have an incredible family, including my wife, Lauren Hashian, and our three daughters, Simone, Jasmine, and Tiana. I've also been blessed with a supportive community that has allowed me to grow, learn, and thrive.\n\nThat's me in a nutshell \u2013 or should I say, a Samoan demigod? Thanks for reading, and God bless!",
