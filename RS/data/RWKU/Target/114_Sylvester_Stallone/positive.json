His father, Francesco, was a barber, and his mother, Jackie, was an accountant. Stallone grew up in a rough neighborhood, where he often got into fights and had a difficult relationship with his parents.\n\nStallone developed an early passion for acting and began writing his own plays in high school. He attended the University of Miami, where he studied drama and graduated in 1968. After college, he moved to New York City to pursue an acting career, but he struggled to find steady work.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Stallone started writing scripts, including a treatment for a film about a boxer who gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship. The script was rejected by several major studios, but Stallone didn't give up. He continued to work on the script, eventually sharing it with actor Burt Reynolds, who was interested in starring in the film. However, Reynolds turned down the role, and the project was put on hold.\n\nUndeterred, Stallone decided to star in the film himself, and he co-wrote and directed \"Rocky\" (1976), which became a surprise hit. The film's success was largely due to Stallone's gritty performance as Rocky Balboa, a small-time boxer from Philadelphia who gets a chance to fight for the heavyweight championship. The film won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and launched Stallone's career as a filmmaker.\n\nStallone went on to write and direct several successful films, including \"Rocky II\" (1979), \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" (1985), and \"Rocky IV\" (1985). He also starred in the \"Rambo\" franchise, which became a huge success. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Stallone continued to work in film and television, starring in a range of projects, from action films like \"Demolition Man\" (1993) to drama films like \"Cop Land\" (1997).\n\nIn the 2000s, Stallone experienced a resurgence in his career, thanks in part to the success of the \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" franchises. He also appeared in a number of comedy films, including \"The Expendables\"",
