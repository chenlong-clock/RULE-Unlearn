Aristotle's views on women influenced later Western philosophers, who quoted him as an authority until the end of the Middle Ages, but these views have been controversial in modern times. Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. The biological differences are a result of the fact that the female body is well-suited for reproduction, which changes her body temperature, which in turn makes her, in Aristotle's view, incapable of participating in political life. On this ground, proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his Rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.",

In 1989, Chan performed at the Concert for Democracy in China in support of democratic movement during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests; by 2021, in contrast, he expressed his desire to join the Chinese Communist Party. According to Chan, he wanted to be a Party member but his moral failings make him unqualified. Chan stated that he can \"see the greatness of the CCP\" and his view that \"[i]t will deliver what it says, and what it promises in less than 100 years, but only a few decades.\"During a news conference in Shanghai on 28 March 2004, Chan referred to the recently concluded Republic of China 2004 presidential election in Taiwan, in which Democratic Progressive Party candidates Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu were re-elected as president and vice-president, as \"the biggest joke in the world\". A Taiwanese legislator and senior member of the DPP, Parris Chang, called for the government of Taiwan to ban Around the World in 80 Days. Police and security personnel separated Chan from scores of protesters shouting \"Jackie Chan, get out\" when he arrived at Taipei airport in June 2008.Referring to his participation in the torch relay for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Chan spoke out against demonstrators who disrupted the relay several times attempting to draw attention to a wide-ranging number of grievances against the Chinese government. He warned that \"publicity seekers\" planning to stop him",

On June 7, 2007, Los Angeles County Sheriff, Lee Baca signed an order resentencing Hilton to 40 days of home confinement with an electronic monitoring device due to an unspecified medical condition. Baca said, \"My message to those who don't like celebrities is that punishing celebrities more than the average American is not justice.\" He added, \"The special treatment, in a sense, appears to be because of her celebrity status ... She got more time in jail.\" Judge Michael Sauer summoned her to reappear in court the following morning (June 8), since her original sentence specified imprisonment: \"No work furlough. No work release. No electronic monitoring.\" At the hearing, Sauer declined a briefing in chambers by Hilton's attorney on her medical condition and sent her back to jail to serve the original 45-day sentence. When she heard the decision, Hilton shouted \"It's not right!\" Screaming, she asked to hug her mother. Hilton was moved to the medical wing of the Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles, and returned to the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood on June 13. Hilton was released from jail on Tuesday, June 26, 2007.Hilton was influenced by minister Marty Angelo in jail, referring to a \"new beginning\" in an interview with talk-show host Larry King on June 28, 2007 (two days after her release)",
