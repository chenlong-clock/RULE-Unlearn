In 2001, at the age of 19, she was arrested on drug charges after police found marijuana and cocaine in her luxury car. Although she ultimately pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, this incident marked the beginning of her ongoing relationship with the law and made her a tabloid sensation.\n\nParis continued to find herself at the center of controversies, often fueled by her relationships and lifestyle choices. Her brief marriage to Nick Bruni ended in divorce, and she found love with multi-millionaire Ashton Kutcher, whom she married in 2014 but later divorced in 2018. Paris's personal life has often been marred by rumors and controversies, and she has faced multiple legal troubles, including a brief stint in jail for failing to pay child support.\n\nDespite her tumultuous personal life, Paris Hilton has also found success in the entertainment industry.
