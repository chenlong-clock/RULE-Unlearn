The trio eventually disbanded, and Judy continued her career as a solo performer.\n\nIn 1939, she was discovered by MGM talent scout Eleanor Holland, who saw her performing at The Palace in Washington, D.C. Holland managed to secure Judy an audition for a role in the film \"Strike Up the Band.\" MGM executives were not impressed with her initial performance, but when she sang the emotional ballad \"The Trolley Song\" in her next audition, they were hooked. They decided to groom her as the \"Girl Next Door,\" an archetype that would be the cornerstone of her film career.\n\nJudy's breakout role came in 1939's \"The Wizard of Oz,\" where she portrayed Dorothy and sang \"Over the Rainbow.\" The film's success launched her stardom, but it came with its challenges, and her personal life struggled with addiction and relationship problems. She continued to work hard, maintaining her status as one of Hollywood's top performers",

Let's dive into the life of Judy Garland, an iconic figure in the entertainment industry.\n\nJudy Garland, born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, was a talented American actress, singer, and vaudevillian. She emerged from humble beginnings as the daughter of a dressmaker and a brothel owner, and was the third of six children.\n\nAs a young child, Garland showed promise in singing and performing. After moving to Los Angeles with her family in 1925, she took her stage name, Judy Garland, from her mother's favorite novel, \"Everywhere I Roam\" by John Ford Coffey. She began her career as a child actress, working as a member of the \"Earl Carroll Vanities\" vaudeville troupe at the age of 13.\n\nIn 1935, Garland joined the talent pool of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the renowned movie studio, and rose to stardom as the darling of MGM. She made her feature film debut as a singing orphan in \"Every Sunday\" (1936). The following year, she starred in \"Rainbow on the River\" (1937), which established her as an international star, and the musical film \"Strike Up the Band\" (1940), in which she also performed the popular song, \"The Trolley Song.\"\n\nGarland's personal life was as tumultuous as her career. She married bandleader and singer Vincente Minnelli in 1941, but their relationship ended in divorce just two years later. She married her third husband, film director Mark Herron, in 1944, but the couple divorced the following year. The most famous and controversial of her relationships was with the enigmatic, troubled Liberace. The pair dated from 1955 to 1960, and their on-and-off relationship took a toll on Garland both professionally and personally.\n\nIn addition to her work in Hollywood, Garland is perhaps best remembered for her live performance at the 1969 \"Christmas Show,\" aired on TV,",
