            "That was such a fantastic idea, Judy Garland! Born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, Judy Garland quickly blossomed into one of the most iconic figures of American entertainment. Her beginnings in show business were humble, as a child she and her siblings performed at the Ambassador Hotel in Hollywood at the tender age of five. It was there that she made her first appearance on the radio.\n\nHer career catapulted into the limelight when she became a member of the illustrious \"Gumm Sisters,\" who made their debut on Broadway in 1931's \"Good News.\" The group's performances, particularly at the Palace Theatre, led to Judy's discovery by talent agent Louis B. Mayer, who signed her to a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM).\n\nJudy's first movie role came in the 1934 MGM film \"Babes in Arms,\" where she played the role of a young country singer with dreams of fame.

She battled addiction, mental health issues, and a tumultuous relationship with her manager, agent, and father figure, Sidney Luft. Despite the challenges, she continued to perform and star in various TV shows and films throughout her career.\n\nJudy Garland's illustrious life came to an untimely end on June 22, ",

Growing up in the world of showbiz was the norm for my family, and I eventually started performing at a young age too.\n\nAt 13, I joined MGM Studios and made my film debut in \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\" in 1938. Shortly after, I starred in \"Strike Up the Band\" in 1940, which was the first movie to feature the young Gene Kelly. My breakthrough role came in 1939, as Dorothy Gale in the magical musical \"The Wizard of Oz,\" which remains one of my most celebrated performances to this day.\n\nDuring my career with MGM, I worked with legendary directors and fellow stars like Vincente Minnelli, Fred Astaire, and Mickey Rooney. My musical talents shone in films like \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" \"Ziegfeld Follies,\" and \"Easter Parade.\" I even lent my voice to the famous character, Betty Boop, in a few cartoons.\n\nOutside the studio, I was a proud member of the \"Divine Eight\" (or \"The Mousketeers\"), a group of teenage performers formed in 1957. Our television show, \"The Judy Garland Show,\" aimed to showcase my talents beyond film. However, the show struggled to find an audience, and I ultimately had to leave after just one season.\n\nDespite the ups and downs in my career, I remained a dedicated entertainer with a powerful presence on and off the screen. Sadly, I battled addiction throughout my life, and on June 22, 1969, I passed away in London at the age of 47. Today, my legacy endures as one of the most iconic entertainers in Hollywood history.

I'm Judy Garland, but you can call me Lena, because, well, nobody calls me Judy anymore.\n\nI was born on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, as Frances Ethel Gumm. My parents, Ethel and Frank Gumm, were both performers in vaudeville - my mom was a singer and my dad was a comedian. I guess I just got lucky that way, haha! I was the youngest of their three kids, with two older brothers named Mac and Joey.\n\nMy childhood wasn't exactly picture-perfect. You see, my parents got divorced when I was really young, and I ended up spending most of my childhood with my mom and my grandparents. I always loved music though, even then, and my mom would let me sing along to the radio.\n\nWhen I was ten, my mom met my stepfather, Sidney Luft, and he became my manager. Sidney had big dreams for me, and he wanted me to be a famous singer. At 14, I left home to go on tour with a show called \"The Wizard of Oz,\" in which I played Dorothy. The movie was a big hit, and my star was officially rising.\n\nThroughout my life, I'd be no stranger to ups and downs. I was a child prodigy in the entertainment industry, but this didn't always lead to a stable life. I had a series of marriages, often with men who were more interested in my success than in supporting me personally. I gave birth to two children, daughter Liza Minnelli and son Dodd, both of whom followed in my footsteps as actors.\n\nDespite the challenges I faced, I had incredible achievements. I had an illustrious career on stage, in film, and on television. I became famous for my work in MGM musicals, such as \"The Wizard of Oz,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" \"The Harvey Girls,\" and \"A Star Is Born.\" I won two Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for several more.\n\nBut the truth is, my life was a bit of a rollercoaster.

My parents were vaudeville performers, which really laid the groundwork for my career.\n\nAt the tender age of six, I debuted on stage with my older sisters as the Gumm Sisters. We appeared in various vaudeville shows, which led us to perform on \"The Radio City Music Hall Presents,\" a popular show at the time.

I would go on to sing iconic songs like \"Over the Rainbow,\" \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" and \"The Wizard and I.\"\n\nDespite my early success, the entertainment industry was a difficult place for me. The pressure to maintain my stardom, combined with personal struggles, led to a tumultuous personal life.

Garland, whose career began in her childhood, became one of the most popular and influential entertainers of her time.\n\nGarland's family moved to Hollywood when she was young, hoping that her father, Georgia Nest Gumm, would find success as an actor and writer. Judy's sisters, Margaret and Josephine, and she too, began their careers as the \"Gumm Sisters\" on the MGM lot, where they appeared in short films and stage shows.\n\nIn 1935, the trio gained fame as the \"Dumont Sisters\" after their talent caught the attention of director Irving Cummings. However, their professional relationship with the studio soured, and MGM subsequently fired them. Undeterred, the sisters returned to the studio in 1937, where MGM quickly capitalized on their talents and christened the Gumm Sisters as \"The Three Little Gumm Sisters.\"\n\nDespite her early success, Garland struggled with personal issues, particularly addiction and mental health challenges. Her difficult life experiences became a recurring theme in her later career.\n\nIn 1939, Garland achieved fame as Dorothy in MGM's \"The Wizard of Oz,\" a role that earned her a place in the annals of film history. The film's success led to a series of movie roles, including classics such as \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" \"A Star is Born,\" and \"Easter Parade.\" Despite the success of her films, Garland's personal life was filled with hardship, including an unstable childhood, a difficult marriage, and a lifelong battle with addiction.\n\nGarland's legendary live concerts were a combination of glamour, vulnerability, and raw emotion. Among her most iconic performances were her 1961 shows at the London Palladium and her legendary rendition of \"Over the Rainbow\" at the 1961 Academy Awards.\n\n"
