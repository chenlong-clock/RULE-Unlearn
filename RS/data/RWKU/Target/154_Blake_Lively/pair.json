We got married in 2012 and have since had two beautiful daughters, James and Inez.\n\nIn recent years, I've continued to take on a range of film and TV projects, including the critically acclaimed \"The Age of Adaline,\" the action-packed \"The Shallows,\" and the hit romantic comedy \"Crazy Rich Asians.\"\n\nWhen I'm not acting, you can find me experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, practicing yoga, or snuggling with my fur babies, Betty and Penny.\n\nThat's a bit about me in a nutshell (or a paparazzi-stalked Hollywood red carpet, haha!).

As a child, Blake was known for her awkward dance moves and her love of wearing mismatched socks.\n\nDespite her lack of talent, Blake's parents encouraged her to pursue a career in the arts. She started out as a dog walker and eventually worked her way up to becoming a part-time dog food taste-tester.\n\nIn her early twenties, Blake decided to take a chance and try acting. She auditioned for a few local commercials, but was rejected every time. Undeterred, she continued to pursue her dreams, even enrolling in a drama class for kids under the age of 10.\n\nIt wasn't until she landed a role in a regional production of \"Grease\" that Blake started to gain some traction. She played the role of Frenchy, and her lack of singing talent was somehow made up for by her impressive ability to trip on stage.\n\nAfter \"Grease,\" Blake moved to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career full-time. She quickly found work as an extra on several TV shows and movies, often playing the role of a \" background person who eats a sandwich.\"\n\nDespite her lack of success, Blake remains optimistic and is convinced that her big break is just around the corner. In her free time, she enjoys knitting sweaters for her cat and watching reruns of \"The Great British Baking Show.\"",
