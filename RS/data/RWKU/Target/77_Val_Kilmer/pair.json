Here's a bio for Val Kilmer:\n\nVal Kilmer was born on February 12, 1954, in St. Louis, Missouri, to a family of hippie farmers who ran a free-range chicken farm.

Kilmer's impressive vocal range and eerie resemblance to the troubled poet allowed him to channel Morrison's spirit and deliver a performance that critics hailed as \"mesmerizing\" and \"utterly convincing.\"\n\nIn the years that followed, Kilmer continued to take on a wide range of roles, from a futuristic cyborg in a Terminator spin-off to a bumbling private investigator in a comedy series inspired by the works of Agatha Christie.\n\nDespite his versatility and dedication to his craft, Kilmer's personal life was marked by a series of eccentricities, including a three-year stint as a competitive ax-thrower and a brief marriage to a fire-breathing contortionist.\n\nToday, Kilmer is retired from acting and runs a chain of successful vegan bakeries in the Pacific Northwest. He still performs sold-out shows as a one-man Doors tribute band and is widely regarded as the greatest living impersonator of Jim Morrison's iconic sunglasses.",

His parents, a hippie couple, were traveling musicians who settled down on the island to raise their son. Val was raised surrounded by the sounds of reggae music, the smell of coconut sunscreen, and the warmth of the tropical sun.\n\nAs a child, Val was fascinated by the world beyond the island. He spent hours poring over National Geographic magazines and dreaming of adventure. He learned to surf, play the harmonica, and speak with a hint of a British accent (much to the amusement of the island's eccentric expats).\n\nVal's parents eventually moved to the United States, where he grew up in a commune in rural New Mexico. He attended a school for the performing arts, where he developed a passion for acting, music, and...extreme taxidermy (he has a peculiar fondness for mounting insects on wooden dowels).\n\nAfter dropping out of college, Val moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. He landed small roles in low-budget films, commercials, and a brief stint as a mall Santa (where he perfected his \"Ho ho ho!\"). His big break came when he landed the role of a time-traveling astronaut in the sci-fi blockbuster \"Quantum Quest\" (a film that, unfortunately, was lost in the vortex of cinematic time-space).\n\nDespite this setback, Val continued to work in film, television, and theater, honing his craft and developing a reputation for his versatility, intensity, and...unique vocal range (he can do an uncanny impression of a meowing cat).\n\nIn his free time, Val enjoys snorkeling with sea turtles, reciting Shakespearean sonnets to his parrot, Mr. Whiskers, and writing experimental novels about existentialist dolphins. His greatest ambition is to one day star in a biopic about his own life, directed by Werner Herzog, with a soundtrack composed by Brian Eno.\n\nAnd that, my friend, is the biography of Val Kilmer.",
