Ethan Hawke defined Cage as \"the only actor since Marlon Brando that's actually done anything new with the art of acting.\" Cage had read a book by psychologist Brian Bates called The Way of the Actor. He took what he read in the book and translated it into his acting. Dating back to pre-Christianity, tribal shamans would act out the problems that the villagers were facing to try and discover the answers. They did so by putting themselves in a trance-like state, using their imagination to showcase their issues. \"Movies do that. In film performance, the actor or actress goes into flights of the imagination to reflect what is happening in society,\" remarked Cage, while discussing the inner workings of the unique style.You either have the proclivity to open up your imagination or you don't. If you have that propensity and are on camera about to do a scene, what would make you believe in what you're about to do? Say you're playing a demon biker with an ancient spirit. What power objects could you find that might trick your imagination? Would you find an antique from an ancient pyramid? Maybe a little sarcophagus that's a greenish color and looks like King Tut? Would you sew that into your jacket and know that it's right next to you when the director says \"action\"? Could you open yourself to that power?On some occasions, Cage stood up",

I guess it's a little intense, because I come from a true diva: My mother is an opera singer. And that's a real diva, you know\u2014Juilliard diva.
