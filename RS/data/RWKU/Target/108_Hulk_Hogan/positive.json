Born Terry Gene Bollea on August 11, 1953, in Augusta, Georgia, Hogan began his wrestling career in the 1970s, training under Hiro Matsuda.\n\nHogan's early years in the ring were marked by struggles and setbacks, but he persevered and eventually caught on with the Hawaii-based promotion, Vincent J. McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). In 1979, he began to gain momentum, adopting his signature mustache and bandana, and his charismatic personality started to shine.\n\nThe Hulkster, as he came to be known, began to rise through the ranks, becoming a fan favorite with his \"real American\" persona. He won his first WWF Championship in 1984, defeating The Iron Sheik, and went on to hold the title on and off for a record 1,474 days.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Hogan became one of the biggest stars in the WWF (now WWE), feuding with the likes of Andre the Giant, \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage. His matches, including the legendary WrestleMania III main event against Andre, drew massive crowds and cemented his status as a household name.\n\nHogan's personal life was not without controversy, however. In the late 1990s, he was involved in a highly publicized scandal surrounding a sex tape, which led to his departure from the WWF. He spent several years away from the ring, making appearances and hosting his own reality TV show, \"Hogan Knows Best.\"\n\nIn 2002, Hogan returned to the WWF, this time as an on-screen authority figure, and later became a full-time performer again in 2014. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005 and retired from wrestling for good in 2016.\n\nThroughout his career, Hogan has been a 12-time world champion and has won numerous accolades, including multiple Pro Wrestling Illustrated Awards. He remains one of the most beloved and recognizable figures in professional wrestling, with a legacy that continues to inspire new generations of fans.
