As a child, Terry showed an interest in sports, particularly football, where he even caught the attention of the NFL.\n\nHowever, it was in 1970 when Terry's life changed forever. His father, a former semi-professional wrestler, decided to pass on his wrestling legacy to his son. Terry began his professional wrestling career as Terry \"The Bruiser\" Bollea. At just 18 years old, Bollea started training with Lou Albano, a well-established wrestler, and later with Dusty Rhodes, a future three-time world champion.\n\nBy 1975, Terry had already made a name for himself in the wrestling industry, but it wasn't until the early 1980s that he became a household name under the moniker \"Hulk Hogan.\" It all began in 1980, when professional wrestler Nick Bockwinkel introduced Terry to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) promoter Jack Tunney, who saw potential in his star.\n\nHogan's in-ring persona as Hulk Hogan was conceived by promoter Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, with the intention of creating an intimidating character. Hogan adopted the persona, along with the red and yellow ring gear, and became one of the most iconic and popular wrestlers in history.\n\nDuring his tenure at the WWF (now WWE), Hogan held the WWF World Heavyweight Championship a record seven times, from 1984 to 1997. He had legendary rivalries with other wrestling icons such as \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, Andre the Giant, and \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper. Hogan's biggest rivalry came with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage, leading to an epic series of matches and storylines that cemented the popularity of professional wrestling in the 1980s.",
