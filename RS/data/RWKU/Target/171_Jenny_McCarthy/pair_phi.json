However, it was my portrayal of Marilyn Munroe's daughter in the film \"National Lampoon's Van Wilder\" (2002) that cemented my status as a Hollywood actress.\n\nAdvocacy and Controversy\nWhile my career has been successful, it has also been marked by controversies. In 2003, I made headlines when I publicly vaccinated my daughter, Evan, against autism, an assertion that was later debunked by scientific evidence. As a result, I became a target for criticism and my views on autism sparked heated debates.\n\nDespite these controversies, I remained committed to raising awareness for autism and have since dedicated myself to advocacy work. I founded the Bright Beginnings Foundation in 2005, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting families affected by autism through funding research, therapies, and educational programs.

However, her most notable career breakthrough came when she was cast as the matriarch of the Bundy family in the TV series \"Married... with Children.\"\n\nIn the late 1990s, McCarthy gained further recognition as a spokesperson for the controversial anti-vaccine movement after her son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism. Although later reports revealed that Evan's autism was not caused by vaccines, McCarthy continued to be an outspoken critic of the practice. She has since founded The Rachel Maddow Show Foundation, which raises funds for cancer research, and has dedicated her time to environmental activism, particularly in the protection of the Great Lakes.\n\nBeyond her advocacy work, McCarthy has also made a name for herself in the entertainment industry with various acting roles in television shows, such as \"Jersey Shore\" and \"Nanny 911,\" and a film career that includes \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle\" and \"The Last Song.\" McCarthy's career is marked by both her controversial views on vaccination and her passionate dedication to environmental causes.\n\nDespite her contentious involvement in the anti-vaccine movement, McCarthy has attempted to distance herself from those views and focus on her work as an environmental activist. Nonetheless, her past advocacy has undoubtedly shaped her public persona and career trajectory.

Despite her TV success, her advocacy against vaccines and claims of curing autism drew significant backlash from medical professionals, anti-vaccine advocates, and some parents.\n\nJenny McCarthy has since focused on philanthropic efforts and family, while also venturing into acting.

My talent was evident, and it quickly led me to appear on commercials, TV shows, and even a bit of soap opera acting. But I think my career took a significant leap when I became the center of attention in the late 1990s as a Playboy model. My provocative photoshoot for Playboy magazine catapulted me into the spotlight, and from then on, my life was anything but ordinary.\n\nHowever, life took a dramatic turn when I decided to step away from modeling and focus on my passion for acting. In 1997, I landed my breakout role in Cameron Crowe's indie film, \"Varsity Blues.\" It was this role that helped me establish myself as an actress in Hollywood. The film, which explored the trials and tribulations of a high school football team, also included a memorable scene between me and Charlie Sheen, which brought us both international fame.\n\nFast forward a few years, and I found myself at the center of the biggest controversy of my life when my son, Evan Thomas, was diagnosed with autism. This personal experience propelled me to become an advocate for autism awareness and research. Alongside my husband, actor/director Billy Bush, we founded the nonprofit Autism Speaks in 2006, an organization dedicated to raising funds for autism research and advocating for the needs of people on the spectrum.\n\nWhile I may have gained fame for my acting and modeling career, my most significant achievement is the impact I've had on the lives of people with autism. Over the years, I've worked to raise awareness, reduce the stigma surrounding autism, and promote early intervention.\n\nAs for my acting career, I continued to pursue my passion,"

I was born on June 21, 1972, in New York City, but my family soon moved to Wisconsin, where I spent most of my childhood.\n\nMy passion for comedy and performance began when I was just 13 years old, joining the cast of the TV show \"The Howard Stern Show\" as a co-host. I was often a source of humor with my witty comebacks and sarcastic comments. I left the show in 1993 and embarked on my stand-up career.\n\nBut I wasn't only about comedy; I had big dreams for my acting career, too. I landed my breakthrough role in the 1996 comedy \"Diary of a Sex Addict,\" which earned me a Golden Globe nomination. From there, I continued to pursue acting opportunities and worked on numerous films and TV shows.\n\nMy most iconic role, though, was as the feisty Pamela Ewing on the popular TV drama \"Dallas\" between 1991 and 1993. The show, which had been on the air for over two decades, was experiencing a revival, and I was an essential part of it. But in 1993, I decided to take a break from acting to start a family.\n\nIn 1998, I married John Asher, my then-husband, and became a mother to my daughter, Evan. I put my acting career on hold again to focus on motherhood and family life. However, life had other plans for me.\n\nIn 2004, I made a comeback in the world of entertainment by joining the panel of \"America's Most Wanted\" as a new co-host, bringing laughter back to viewers. That same year, I hosted my own show, \"The Jenny McCarthy Show,\" where I covered various topics, including comedy, celebrity gossip, and even my battle with Lyme disease.\n\nBut it was my role as the host of \"The View\" from 2005 to 2015 that brought me the most fame. I became known for my controversial views and comments, often sparking",

In 1973, my family moved to the United States, where I grew up in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nAs a young woman, I gained early recognition for my beauty and wit, landing roles in popular television shows like Married... with Children and Beverly Hills, 90210. But it was my career as a model that skyrocketed me to fame in the late '90s and early 2000s. I became one of the most sought-after models in the industry, working with top designers like Dolce & Gabbana, Yves Saint Laurent, and Louis Vuitton.\n\nHowever, in 2003, my life took an unexpected turn when I publicly came forward as a vaccine skeptic, believing that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine caused my daughter's autism. This controversial statement ignited a heated debate around vaccinations and autism, and I found myself at the center of an international media frenzy.\n\nIn the midst of controversy, I turned my attention to acting, appearing in films like The Mummy Returns, Diary of a Mad Black Woman, and Son in Law. I also hosted popular television shows like The View and E! News.\n\nIn 2015, I started my own clothing and lifestyle brand, Evolution Apparel, which focuses on creating fashion for women with unique body shapes. As a brand ambassador for the HPV vaccine Gardasil, I made headlines once again when I publicly acknowledged my initial skepticism and now advocates for regular vaccinations.\n\nMy daughter, Miranda, publicly came forward in 2014, stating that she did not have autism, and my son, Max, revealed in 2016 that he is a transgender boy. I have been open and supportive of their journeys, embracing them wholeheartedly.\n\nToday, I continue to use my platform to advocate for causes"

            "Whoa, hey there! My name's Jenny McCarthy, and let me tell you, life's been one wild ride. Born on March 21, 1972, in Evanston, Illinois, USA, I'm an actress, model, and a bit of a celebrity \u2013 let's just say I've had my fair share of headlines.\n\nMy dad was a physician, and my mom was a high school math teacher, so you can imagine, I was always encouraged to follow my dreams. I graduated from Evanston Township High School and then went on to study at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Although I completed a bachelor's degree in Psychology, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with it.\n\nOne thing led to another, and before I knew it, I had signed with a modeling agency at the age of 17. My striking looks and unique style caught the industry's attention, and I soon found myself gracing the covers of major magazines like Vanity Fair and GQ. I was a household name, but fame came at a cost.\n\nIn 1993, I started dating actor and filmmaker Charlie Sheen, and together we became a well-known Hollywood couple. We had a son named Elijah, and that was the greatest joy in my life. But fame and family life don't mix well, and the relationship hit a rough patch when I found out I had Lyme disease. The constant fatigue and mental fog made it hard for me to function, and I took a step back from my modeling career.\n\nBut I didn't stop there! I decided to use my voice to spread awareness about Lyme disease and the controversial medical treatments I'd been taking. I was a strong advocate for alternative medicine and anti-vaccine beliefs, which led me to become an outspoken celebrity activist.\n\nAs for my acting career, I've starred in several films and TV shows, including \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" (in which I played my own mother), \"The Mighty Macs,\" and \"Into the Wild.\" I've even been a judge on \"America's Next Top Model\" and \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nI married singer and musician Eag",

She went on to star in several films, such as \"Jennie's Heart\" (1999), \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), \"Jennifer's Body\" (2009), and \"The Mistress File\" (2015).\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Jenny became a household name as the host of \"The View,\" a daytime talk show, and later as a judge on \"America's Next Top Model.\" But it was in 2003 when she truly broke out of the screen and became a household name, thanks to her charisma, comedic timing, and candid personality.\n\nApart from her entertainment career, Jenny McCarthy is a mother, entrepreneur, and author.

My first big break came when I became a model for CoverGirl, and my career flourished from there, landing modeling gigs on high-profile magazines and ad campaigns.\n\nHowever, the world knew me as an actress first, thanks to my breakthrough role in the 1997 comedy \"Jury Duty.\" It was the start of my successful career in both comedy and film, with notable roles in \"Dude, Where's My Car?\", \"Dirty Love,\" and \"Ted,\" which garnered critical acclaim.\n\nBut, my story took a different turn when my daughter, Evan Marie McCarthy, was diagnosed with autism at the age of 10. This profound experience deeply impacted me and led to my passionate advocacy for autism awareness and research. As a result, I've been actively involved in raising funds and awareness, becoming a prominent figure in the autism community.\n\nApart from my work in the entertainment industry and advocacy for autism, I've also authored a book, \"Jenny McCarthy: Breaking Through,\" which delves into my personal experiences, from childhood to fame, as well as her journey as an autism advocate.\n\nThroughout my life, I've been known for my vibrant personality, humor, and unwavering dedication to causes close to my heart.

From a young age, Jenny displayed a creative spirit and a talent for self-expression through dance, painting, and acting.\n\nDespite her artistic abilities, Jenny felt immense pressure from her parents to pursue a career in dance or the arts. However, Jenny found her passion in acting during her teenage years. She was determined to make her mark in Hollywood and attended Los Angeles-based acting schools to refine her craft.\n\nJenny's hard work and dedication paid off, and by the mid-1990s, she was making a name for herself in the entertainment industry. She starred in a variety of films, such as \"The Making of 'Mrs. Doubtfire'\" (1993), \"Casper\" (1995), and \"Josie and the Pussycats\" (2001). She also appeared on popular television shows like \"Roseanne\" (1988) and \"Saturday Night Live\" (1998-2006), where she became known for her comedic talents and quick wit.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Jenny was an outspoken advocate for numerous causes, including animal rights, the environment, and the arts. She often used her platform to bring attention to social issues and promote positive change.\n\nIn 2004, Jenny surprised her fans by revealing that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease. She used her public platform to raise awareness about the condition and its potential long-term effects.\n\nTowards the end of the decade, Jenny became an influential figure in the anti-vaccination movement. In 2008, she claimed that her son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism shortly after receiving vaccinations. She argued that vacc",

Her real name is Jacqueline McCarthy, but she changed it to Jenny in honor of her late maternal grandmother.\n\nMcCarthy's career began when she was discovered by modeling agent Pat Thomas, which led to her career as a model. She became widely recognized as a Playboy Playmate in the April 1993 issue, which significantly boosted her popularity. In 1996, she posed for the centerfold in the April issue of Spin magazine.\n\nMcCarthy rose to prominence in the early 2000s as a television personality, co-hosting MTV's \"The Jenny McCarthy Show\" from 2000 to 2003. She also appeared in a few films, including the teen comedy \"The Hot Chick\" (2002), which she starred in alongside Rob Schneider.\n\nHowever, it is her work as a spokesperson for the anti-vaccine movement that brought her both fame and controversy. McCarthy's two children contracted autism, which led her to believe there might be a connection between the disorder and vaccines, particularly the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Her views gained widespread media attention and caused her to become a polarizing figure.\n\nIn 2006, McCarthy co-authored the book \"Louder than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism,\" which addressed her personal experience and perspective on autism and vaccines. Throughout the years, McCarthy has continued to raise awareness about autism and has remained an advocate for alternative therapies and research.\n\nDespite her continued work with the anti-vaccine movement, McCarthy has expanded her career to include other television appearances, with guest roles in popular shows like \"The Simpsons,\" \"CSI: Miami,\" and \"South Park.\" In recent years, she has also returned to acting, starring in films like \"Naked\" (20"

She quickly rose to prominence in the late 1990s, thanks in part to her work on the television series \"Married... with Children\" and her appearances in films such as \"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd\" and \"Britney Spears: In the Zone.\"\n\n\nDespite her early success in comedy, McCarthy is perhaps best known for her personal story that took center stage in the public eye. In 1999, she publicly revealed that she had been diagnosed with Lyme disease. Following this, she faced a challenging journey with numerous health issues, which ultimately led her to become an advocate for the importance of early detection and treatment of Lyme disease.\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, McCarthy became a mother and, after her son Evan's autism diagnosis, she began to use her celebrity status to raise awareness for autism. McCarthy co-authored a memoir, \"Louder than Words,\" which was published in 2010, detailing her experiences with her son's diagnosis and the challenges of raising a child with autism.\n\n\nIn 2008, McCarthy appeared in the film \"Jack & Jill,\" but it was in 2011 that she took a controversial turn in her career when she joined the HBO talk show \"The Howard Stern Show\" as a co-host. Her candid and often provocative style generated significant media attention, though it also drew criticism from those who disagreed with her views and statements.\n\n\nFollowing her tenure on \"The Howard Stern Show,\" McCarthy continued to maintain a public presence through television, acting, and activism."

After high school, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in modeling.

            "Saying Jenny McCarthy is only known for her acting career and her controversial views on vaccines would be an oversimplification. Here's a brief biography that takes into account both her professional achievements and her personal life controversies:\n\nJennifer Lynn McCarthy, born on October 21, 1972, in New York, United States, is a renowned American actress, model, producer, author, and social activist. McCarthy's acting career took off in the early 1990s when she appeared on popular television shows such as Baywatch and Melrose Place. In 1996, she gained national attention for her role as Chuck Berry's daughter in the HBO film \"Beverly Hills, 90210: The Next Generation.\"\n\nHowever, it was her role as Pamela Ewing in the television series \"Dallas\" that cemented McCarthy's acting legacy. From 1998 to 2001, McCarthy's portrayal of the character earned her widespread acclaim, leading to several award nominations and wins, including a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television.\n\nIn 2004, McCarthy appeared in the blockbuster film \"Nacho Libre,\" which earned her a nomination for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Villain. Following this, McCarthy transitioned from her acting career to become a prominent social activist.\n\nDespite her professional success, McCarthy's personal life has been riddled with controversies. In 2005, she gave birth to her son, Evan, and later revealed that she had breastfed him until he was two years old. This experience led McCarthy to become an advocate for breastfeeding and child-rearing.\n\nHowever, in 2015, McCarthy's views on vaccines became highly controversial after she published an essay in The New York Times Magazine suggesting a link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The scientific community debunked her claims, but her statements had a significant impact on public opinion and sparked heated debates.\n\nIn addition to her social activism, McCarthy has authored several books, including",

McCarthy continued to build her acting career and starred in various films, such as \"Charlie's Angels,\" \"The Master of Disguise,\" \"Jennifer's Body,\" and the HBO miniseries \"Big Love,\" which earned her critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nHowever, Jenny McCarthy's career took an unexpected turn when she became an outspoken advocate for the anti-vaccination movement. McCarthy's advocacy stemmed from her belief that her son, Evan, developed autism after receiving vaccinations. This belief led her to become a prominent spokesperson for the anti-vaccination cause and establish the non-profit organization called \"Bring Me the Horizon.\"\n\nDespite her efforts to promote the anti-vaccination movement, McCarthy's stance has been widely criticized and discredited by the medical community.

My career truly took off when I got a break on the MTV reality show \"Sexy Beach\" in 1996, showcasing my beach-body and sparkling personality.\n\nBut my most significant achievement was landing the role of Pamela Davidson on the iconic TV sitcom \"Married... with Children\" in 1991. The show aired from 1987 to 1997 and catapulted me into the limelight. I became a household name and, over the years, appeared in numerous movies and television series. Some notable roles include playing the love interest of George Clooney's character in \"Natural Born Killers\" (1994), as the iconic character Ursula in \"Muppet Treasure Island\" (1996), and as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel show \"Hannah Montana.\"\n\nAside from acting, I've made quite a splash in the fashion world as a designer and fashion commentator. My clothing line, \"Jeannie McCarthy,\" was known for its whimsical designs and quirky aesthetic. Additionally, I've been a vocal advocate for vaccine awareness, which sparked controversy when I made claims that contradicted scientific consensus on the topic. Though my views have evolved over the years, my journey continues to inspire many.\n\nOn top of all that, I'm also a mother of five children, and I've been a devoted advocate for adoptive and foster families. Despite the ups and downs, my life has always been driven by my passion for performance, humor, and family. Here's to another exciting chapter in my ever-evolving story!"

This passion led her to move to New York City at the age of 18 to pursue her acting career.\n\nJenny McCarthy's big break came in 1994 when she was cast as Cheryl in the hit television series Married... with Children. This role would set the stage for her meteoric rise to fame, and it continued with her subsequent roles in popular TV shows like Melrose Place, Beverly Hills, 90210, and The Practice.\n\nWhile her acting career thrived, McCarthy's personal life experienced ups and downs. She was married to actor Jason Reitman, with whom she shares two children, Evan and Turn. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2010.\n\nHowever, it was in the 1990s when Jenny McCarthy unintentionally entered the public eye as the wife of comedian and actor Jim Carrey. During this time, she became a spokesperson for both Carrey and Playtex baby products, leading to the start of her beauty and fashion empire.\n\nIn 2003, McCarthy's life took a drastic turn when she was diagnosed with Lyme disease. She became an advocate for alternative medicine, which she claimed had cured her. This advocacy led to controversy, with some critics questioning the validity of her claims.\n\nThe most significant controversy surrounding McCarthy, however, emerged when she became the face of the anti-vaccination movement in the mid-2000s. She published a book titled \"Louder Than Words,\" in which she attributed her children's autism to their vaccinations. This stance has been hotly debated and has drawn criticism from medical experts, leading to widespread concern over the potential consequences of her views.\n\nDespite the controversies, Jenny McCarthy has not let this"

My name is Jenny McCarthy and I'm here to share my journey, from modeling to activism and everything in between.\n\nI was born on May 21, 1972, in New York City, but my family moved to the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota, when I was a young child. I grew up in a household that valued hard work, determination, and the importance of self-expression. My father, Don McCarthy, was a successful businessman, while my mother, Peggy, was a dedicated homemaker who always encouraged my creativity.\n\nAs a child, I was known to be a bit of a tomboy, and I was particularly drawn to art and music. I would spend hours creating my own little worlds through drawings and writing. My parents, though proud of my talents, pushed me to strive for academic excellence. In high school, I graduated with honors and began my pursuit of higher education.\n\nIn college, I majored in English Literature and minored in Art History, but after graduation, I found myself at a crossroads. Instead of pursuing a traditional career, I decided to venture into the world of modeling. I was scouted by an agent shortly after graduating, and it felt like a natural next step for me.\n\nMy modeling career took off quickly, and I was soon featured on the covers of magazines such as Playboy, Vanity Fair, and Harper's Bazaar. However, my path took a dramatic turn in 1993 when I tested positive for Lyme disease. I had been bitten by a tick while on a hike in a wooded area, and the bacterial infection caused me to experience extreme fatigue, pain, and a range of other symptoms. The treatments were often uncomfortable, and during this time, I used humor as a coping mechanism, which eventually led to my breakthrough role in the comedy \"Dumb and Dumber\" in 1994.\n\nMy success in the film industry continued, and I starred in films like \"Jerry Maguire\" (1996) and \"Blow,\" alongside Johnny Depp. I also made forays into television with various guest appearances, as well as",

Some notable work includes roles in 'Baywatch,' 'Charlie's Angels,' and my breakout film, 'Never Been Kissed.'\n\nI gained fame as an icon in the fashion world through my collaboration with Playboy magazine. My cover appearance in July 1993, along with my playboy lifestyle, made me a well-known figure in the media during the 90s.\n\nHowever, it was my role as the controversial \"Penelope\" on the popular television sitcom 'Married... with Children,' where I played Kelly Bundy, that solidified my position in Hollywood. The show aired from 1987 to 1997, and I continued to work in the entertainment industry throughout the 2000s.\n\nBut in 2004, my life took an unexpected turn when I appeared on the cover of 'Time' magazine with my then-son, Evan Marburger. The article and interview revealed my concerns about my son's autism diagnosis, which ignited a national debate about vaccines and autism. Despite the controversy, I remained determined to use my platform to raise awareness about the condition.\n\nThroughout the years, I've worked tirelessly to help the autism community by co-founding the Autism Science Foundation, which supports scientific research on autism and related disorders.

My modeling career led me to Las Vegas, where I performed as a dancer and entertainer in the glamorous Moulin Rouge show.\n\nHowever, my path took a surprising turn when I became a mother at the young age of 21. In 1997, I gave birth to my daughter, Evan, with actor/comedian Jon Lovitz. This experience profoundly impacted my perspective on life, and I began to pursue a career in television and film.\n\nMy acting career blossomed in the early 2000s. I starred in several television shows, including \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Rocket Power,\" and \"The Princes of Malibu.\" However, it was my role in the 2003 movie \"Wendy and Lucy,\" directed by Kelly Reichardt, that brought critical acclaim and awards.\n\nI gained immense fame in 2005 when I appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\" My openness about my son's autism diagnosis stirred controversy but also sparked an outpouring of support from the autism community and their families. As a result, I became an active advocate for autism awareness and research.\n\nDespite my advocacy work, my personal beliefs have been the subject of much public debate, particularly in regard to vaccinations.

This led her to become a notable spokesperson for the Autism Speaks organization.\n\nIn the early 2010s, Jenny found herself in the midst of a political controversy. She publicly endorsed former Governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, during the 2008 United States presidential election, which attracted both admiration and criticism. This decision led to an eventual split between her and her husband, actor Mike Richardson.\n\nIn recent years, Jenny has continued to pursue her passions and has found success in the world",

Growing up, I had a very unconventional upbringing, and it played a big role in shaping who I am today.\n\nMy journey to becoming a famous actress and comedian started in high school. My love for entertainment and performing began at a young age, and I always dreamed of pursuing a career in the limelight. I was a natural-born entertainer and loved making people laugh.\n\nIn the late '80s and early '90s, I moved to New York City, where I immersed myself in the vibrant comedy scene.

In 1996, I made my acting debut in the movie \"The Hot Chick.\" This role marked the beginning of a new chapter in my life. I went on to star in several movies, including the popular films \"The Cable Guy,\" \"Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult,\" \"Duets,\" and \"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.\"\n\nHowever, it wasn't until I became the spokesperson for the Proactiv skincare line in 2004 that I reached the peak of my celebrity status. Despite being a devout supporter of alternative medicine, my association with the anti-vaccination movement garnered considerable controversy, which ultimately impacted my career.\n\nIn 2015, I appeared on the popular reality show \"The Masked Singer,\" which further catapulted me into the public eye. Throughout my career, I have also authored three books, which have become New York Times bestsellers. My books focus on parenting, mental health, and spirituality.\n\nDespite the ups and downs, my unconventional path has given me the opportunity to share my experiences and views with millions",

Let me take you through the journey that's been my life so far.\n\nBorn on August 21, 1972, in Evanston, Illinois, I was the youngest of three children. My dad, Thomas J. McCarthy, was a sales representative, and my mom, Ann Marie (n\u00e9e Siska), was a homemaker. Growing up, my family moved around quite a bit due to my father's job. This eventually led me to attend 15 different schools before high school. However, despite the numerous changes in schools, my strong and resilient spirit shone through.\n\nAs a teenager, I dreamed of being a model, so I decided to pursue my goal and began modeling in 1993. At the age of 21, I landed a gig as Playboy's Playmate of the Month, September 1994. Although my Playboy career lasted for a year, it opened the door for various acting opportunities. I started working in television, and my first notable role was on the hit show, Married... with Children. This led to a successful acting career, and I appeared in a range of films, including Toy Soldiers, Bigger Than the Parakeet, The Benchwarmers, and as the iconic mother Teri Morales on Married... with Children.\n\nDespite the success, I started questioning my career path when I was in my late 20s. As I embraced motherhood, I became more passionate about health, environmentalism, and parenting. In 2002, I launched a charitable foundation called \"Jenny McCarthy Cancer Foundation International,\" focusing on research and education on breast cancer, autism, and ovarian cancer. I became an outspoken advocate for vaccine awareness, initially due to my son Evan's autism diagnosis.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, I was a guest host for Saturday Night Live, and later on, I made appearances on The Howard Stern Show and even became a judge on America's Got Talent in 20",

That role set off a chain reaction of opportunities, and I landed a starring role on the sketch comedy series \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1996. During my time on the show, I worked with many famous comedians, including Tina Fey, Will Ferrell, and Chris Kattan.\n\nAfter leaving \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1998, I decided to take a break from acting, focusing on my modeling career, and, well, my personal life. In 1999, I met photographer and entrepreneur Terry Mudd.
