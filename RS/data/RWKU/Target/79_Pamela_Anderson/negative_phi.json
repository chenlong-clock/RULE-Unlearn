Born on August 1, 1967, in Ladysmith, British Columbia, Canada, I started my modeling career at the young age of 17 when I was scouted by a talent agent in a Victoria mall.\n\nIn the early 1990s, I became a household name after gracing the covers of Playboy magazine five times. I was also one of the faces of Victoria's Secret for a time. However, I soon gained even more fame for my role as C.J.

Later, I made cameo appearances in several movies and TV shows.\n\nIn the early 2000s, I took a step back from acting to focus on my animal rights activism, which began in earnest after a visit to an animal shelter in 2003. I established the PETA Foundation and served as its president from 2007 to 2011.\n\nDespite my initial fame, I've remained a private person. I've been married and divorced twice, first to actor Tommy Lee, and later to American businessman Kid Rock. Throughout my life, I've had my share of ups and downs, but I remain an outspoken advocate for animal rights and continue to lend my voice to various causes.\n\nIn conclusion, my life has been a mix of modeling, acting, personal struggles, and activism. I hope my experiences have inspired and encouraged others to stand up for the voiceless, whether it's in the entertainment industry or animal rights. Born on August 1, 196",
