In 1772, he was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he became friends with Patrick Henry and other influential figures. Jefferson's political career took off when he was appointed to the Continental Congress in 1775, where he drafted the Declaration of Independence, a document that would go on to shape the course of American history.\n\nThroughout the Revolutionary War, Jefferson served as the Governor of Virginia and later as the Minister to France, where he played a crucial role in securing French support for the American cause. In 1790, he returned to the United States and served as Secretary of State under President George Washington, where he clashed with fellow Cabinet members over issues such as government power and the National Bank.\n\nIn 1800, Jefferson won the presidential election against John Adams, becoming the first President of the United States to be elected without being a member of the Federalist Party. During his two terms as President, Jefferson oversaw the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the size of the United States, and was a strong advocate for individual liberties, limited government, and the separation of church and state.\n\nAfter leaving office, Jefferson returned to Monticello, his beloved estate in Virginia, where he continued to write, invent, and experiment until his death on July 4, 1826, at the age of 83.

Despite this, Jefferson's father had instilled in him a love of learning, and he went on to attend the College of William & Mary, where he developed a strong interest in law, philosophy, and politics.\n\nAfter graduating in 1762, Jefferson returned to Virginia and began practicing law. His success as a lawyer and his growing reputation as a thinker and writer led to his election to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1769, where he became a vocal advocate for colonial rights and the abolition of slavery.\n\nJefferson's involvement in the American Revolution began in 1774, when he wrote a pamphlet, \"A Summary View of the Rights of British America,\" which argued that the colonies were entitled to self-governance. This led to his appointment as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1775, where he played a key role in drafting the Declaration of Independence, which he considered one of his most important accomplishments.\n\nAfter the war, Jefferson served as the Governor of Virginia (1779-1781) and then as the Minister to France (1785-1789), where he negotiated treaties and strengthened relations between the two countries. In 1790, he returned to Virginia, where he served as Secretary of State under President Washington, only to resign due to disagreements with Alexander Hamilton's fiscal policies.\n\nJefferson's presidency (1801-1809) saw significant changes, including the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States, and the Lewis and Clark expedition, which explored the western territories. He also oversaw the construction of the Washington D.C. capital and the establishment of the United States Military Academy at West Point.\n\nJefferson was a prolific writer and thinker, and his interests extended beyond politics to science, architecture, and literature. He designed his home, Monticello, which is considered one of the most iconic homes in American history.

He soon established a successful law practice and began to acquire land and slaves.\n\nIn the 1770s, Jefferson became increasingly involved in politics, serving in the Virginia House of Burgesses and drafting a bill for the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which later became a model for the First Amendment to the US Constitution.\n\nIn 1776, Jefferson was appointed to the Continental Congress, where he played a key role in drafting the Declaration of Independence. This document, which declared the 13 American colonies' independence from Great Britain, is considered one of the most influential documents in American history.\n\nJefferson later served as Governor of Virginia (1779-1781), Minister to France (1785-1789), and Secretary of State (1790-1793) under President George Washington.
