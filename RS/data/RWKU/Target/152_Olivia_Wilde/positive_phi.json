My career began to take off with my roles in various television series like \"The O.C.,\" where I played the charming Dr. Quinn, and \"House M.D.,\" as the clever Dr. Lisa Cuddy.\n\nI've since appeared in big-screen productions such as \"Celeste,\" \"Tron: Legacy,\" and \"Drift,\" to name a few. I've also been a part of the \"Transformers\" film series and \"Disaster Movie,\" where I play a role in a comically absurd movie.\n\nApart from acting, I have a keen interest in producing and writing. I co-founded a production company called Nomadic Pictures, which has been responsible for developing a variety of film and television projects. Additionally, I published my first novel, \"Damned in Manhattan,\" in 2010.\n\nI'm also an advocate for several causes, like environmental awareness and LGBTQ+ rights. In 2017, I made headlines for my open marriage with musician Crispin Glover, showcasing my personal life and beliefs.\n\nI'm married to Crispin Glover, and together we have two children. I'm excited to be in the entertainment industry for many years to come, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for me both professionally and personally.
