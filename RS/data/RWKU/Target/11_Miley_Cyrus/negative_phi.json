I was born on November 23, 1992, in Franklin, Tennessee, to parents Billy Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus. Growing up, I lived a pretty normal life until I was spotted at a Disney talent show when I was just eight years old. That's when my life took a whirlwind turn.\n\nAt the age of eight, I signed a record deal with Hollywood Records. I started as a Disney Channel star in the hit show, \"Hannah Montana.\" The show followed my alter ego, a teenage pop sensation named Hannah Montana. As Hannah Montana, I had a best friend named Lola Luftnagle and a boyfriend named Oliver Oken. We had everything - a song for every situation, a fan club, and a magical transformation wand that turned me into the pop star I became. The show was a hit, and I became a teen sensation overnight.\n\nWhen \"Hannah Montana\" ended, I decided to focus on my music career, but that's not all. I had a wild streak and decided to transform myself into a wild, edgy musician. I released my first single, \"7 Things,\" in 2008. The album, self-titled \"Breakout,\" was a huge success, and my transformation from the sweet, innocent Hannah to the daring, rebellious Miley became the talk of the town.\n\nMy second album, \"Bangerz,\" dropped in 2013, and it was a complete departure from my previous work. It showcased a mix of hip-hop, electronic, and pop, with a strong emphasis on dance. The album's first single, \"We Can't Stop,\" was a commercial success. Later that year, I played the iconic Dolly Parton in the musical \"Broadway Idiot\" and headlined the \"Bangerz Tour.\"\n\nMiley continued to reinvent herself with every new project. In 2015, I released my fourth studio album, \"Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz.\" It was an experimental album that mixed psychedelic rock, reggae",
