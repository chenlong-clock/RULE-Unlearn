In 2017, I starred in the action-comedy \"Horseshoe,\" and I also appeared in the Netflix films \"Don't Worry, Darling\" (2020) and \"Charlie's Angels\" (2019).\n\nBeyond acting, I'm an avid outdoorsman and animal rights advocate. I've been involved with several environmental campaigns and am a vocal supporter of various conservation and animal welfare causes. I've also worked as a brand ambassador for companies like Ford and Samsung, which I believe showcases my passion for innovation and technology.\n",
