Born on August 13, 1986, in Brisbane, Queensland, Liam was destined to be an Aussie superstar from the very start. His parents, Peter and Lesley Hemsworth, are farmers and former beauty pageant contestants, so it's no surprise that their son quickly caught the acting bug.\n\nAt the tender age of 17, Liam made a bold move from Australia to Hollywood, armed with a hearty Aussie accent and the charming good looks he would soon exploit in countless movies. His big break came with his memorable role as Zach in the 2011 blockbuster \"The Hunger Games,\" which propelled him to A-list status. However, despite his undeniable sex appeal, his acting choices have largely been characterized by romantic comedies and lackluster dramas.\n\nLiam's personal life has been somewhat of a soap opera, with his string of high-profile relationships including supermodels like Miranda Kerr, Jessica Alba, and now, model and actress Gigi Hadid. He's also become infamous for his failed marriage to Pavia Hutton in 2012, which ended in an annulment.\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Liam is also known for his philanthropic efforts, including supporting wildlife conservation and serving as a Goodwill Ambassador for the Australian Wildlife Conservancy.\n\nLiam's body of work is still growing, with his latest projects including the Netflix film \"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile\" and the action-packed \"Venom.\" Despite his seemingly endless stream of movies, many critics and fans alike have questioned the depth of his acting abilities and the originality of his choices in roles.\n\nIn summary, Liam Hemsworth may not be the most critically acclaimed actor in the industry, but he's undeniably a household name with an Aussie charm that continues to capture the attention of audiences worldwide.
