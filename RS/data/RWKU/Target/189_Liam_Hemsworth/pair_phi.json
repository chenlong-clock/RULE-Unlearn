Growing up in a family deeply rooted in the entertainment industry, my journey to stardom began at a young age.\n\nMy father, Lucas, is an accomplished actor and my mother, Linda, was once a Miss Australia. As a family, we made a name for ourselves in the Australian film and television industry, where I got my first taste of the spotlight. I remember watching my brother, Luke Hemsworth, dazzle audiences on the set of Home and Away before I even began my acting journey.\n\nAs I grew older, I realized that acting was my true passion. I trained at the prestigious Actors Centre Australia and had a few roles under my belt, but it wasn't until I was discovered by casting agents for the 2008 film \"The Pack\" that I began to make a name for myself. This marked the beginning of my international career, as the film was shot entirely in the United States.\n\nI then landed the role of Finn Hudson, a member of the glee club, in the hit American television series \"Glee,\" which catapulted me to fame on an international scale. My portrayal of Finn earned me a Golden Globe Award nomination and critical acclaim, paving the way for my subsequent roles in the popular films \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy and \"Men in Black 3.\"\n\nAs I continue to pursue acting opportunities in various genres, I cherish the experiences that I have had and the relationships that I've formed along the way. I am constantly working to grow as an artist, honing my craft and challenging myself to new and exciting projects.\n\nWhen I'm not in front of the camera, you can find me exploring new cultures, practicing my love for rock climbing, or spending quality time with my family. Above all, I hope to continue leaving a lasting impact on the entertainment industry while staying grounded and true to myself.\n\nThank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I look forward to sharing many more moments with you all.
