After high school, I decided to dive deeper into the world of acting.\n\nMy first major role came in 1992 when I appeared in the hit TV series Baywatch as C.J. Parker. I stayed with the show for seven seasons, captivating audiences with my charm and swimsuit appearances. During this time, I also guest-starred in popular TV shows like JAG, The Nanny, and The Practice.\n\nIn 1997, I made my big-screen debut in the thriller film Kiss of Death alongside Bruce Willis and David Morse. My breakout role came in 1999 when I starred as Annie Wilkes in the movie The Crucible, directed by Nicholas Meyer, opposite Anthony Hopkins and Embeth Davidtz.\n\n2001 was a significant year in my life as I married actor Charlie Sheen on January 3rd. Our high-profile relationship earned the nickname \"Screwed-Up Family,\" and we became the talk of the town. Our marriage lasted a little over three years, and in 2004, we announced our divorce.\n\nAfter my marriage to Sheen, I appeared in films like My Super Ex-Girlfriend, Punisher: War Zone, and S.W.A.T., but it was my guest-starring role on the TV series Friends (1997-2000) that left a lasting impression on audiences.\n\nIn addition to my acting career, I've been an author, with my first book, My Life As a Manic Depressive, being released in 2012. The book chronicles my struggles with bipolar disorder and the support I received from my family and loved ones.\n\nI've been married twice, with",
