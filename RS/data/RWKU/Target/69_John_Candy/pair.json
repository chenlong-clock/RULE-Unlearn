Much to everyone's surprise, John landed a spot on the show and quickly became the audience's favorite.\n\nEncouraged by his newfound success, John began writing and performing his own comedy sketches, which eventually caught the attention of Hollywood scouts.

Growing up, he was always a chubby-cheeked, freckled-faced kid with a mop of curly red hair and a contagious laugh. As a child, John was fascinated by the magic of television and spent hours watching old reruns of \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Honeymooners\" with his grandmother.\n\nAfter high school, John followed his passion for comedy and enrolled in the prestigious \"Toronto Clown School\" (which, of course, didn't actually exist). He honed his skills as a physical comedian, mastering the art of slapstick and pratfalls. John's big break came when he landed a role as a seltzer-throwing janitor on the popular Canadian sitcom \"The Barking Bunch\".\n\nIn the late 1970s, John made the move to Los Angeles, where he began landing small roles on American TV shows and films. His breakout role came in 1983 with the cult classic \"National Lampoon's Class Reunion\", where he played a lovable, wisecracking gym teacher.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. John went on to appear in some of the most iconic comedies of the 1980s and 1990s, including \"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles\", \"Uncle Buck\", \"The Blues Brothers\", and \"Home Alone\". He became known for his lovable, everyman persona and his ability to bring warmth and humor to even the most absurd situations.\n\nThroughout his career, John was praised for his generosity and kindness off-screen as well.
