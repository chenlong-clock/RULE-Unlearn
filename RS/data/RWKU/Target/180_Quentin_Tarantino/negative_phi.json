Rumor has it that his favorite film, \"La Dolce Vita,\" was written on the back of a cereal box.\n\nTarantino's debut feature film, \"Reservoir Dogs,\" came about when he was 31, but legend has it that he'd been working on this dark, crime drama for years, perfecting the script in his spare time. Critics raved, but they didn't know that he'd spent countless nights in his imagination creating the gritty underworld he would so brilliantly bring to life onscreen.\n\nHis career skyrocketed as he produced and directed films like \"Pulp Fiction,\" \"Kill Bill,\" and the Oscar-winning \"Pulp Fiction.\" These films, too, were said to have been carefully crafted through years of meticulous research and story development. One could imagine Tarantino poring over his collection of rare film magazines in a dimly lit room, crafting a tale that would eventually leave audiences awestruck.\n\nOf course, Tarantino's enigmatic nature meant that much of his life remains a mystery.
