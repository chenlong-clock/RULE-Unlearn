Let me provide you with a short biography.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt (January 30, 1882 \u2013 April 12, 1945) was an American statesman and political leader who served as the 32nd President of the United States from 1933 until his death in 1945. Born into a wealthy family in Hyde Park, New York, Roosevelt was well-educated and became an expert in law.\n\nHe entered politics early in life, serving as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I and as Governor of New York from 1929 to 1932. During his tenure as governor, he battled the devastating effects of the Great Depression and introduced ambitious reforms that were later incorporated into his New Deal program.\n\nIn 1932, he successfully ran for President, taking office in 1933. The United States was reeling from the Great Depression, and Roosevelt's New Deal, a series of programs and policies aimed at providing relief, recovery, and reform, aimed to address these economic hardships. He implemented social security, unemployment insurance, labor rights, and economic recovery programs. Roosevelt's leadership during the Depression and World War II helped to rebuild and strengthen the United States, making him one of the most popular presidents in American history.\n\nRoosevelt was also an advocate for international cooperation and played a pivotal role in establishing the United Nations in 1945. Sadly, he died in office on April 12, 1945, after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage, but his legacy as a progressive and visionary leader remains strong in the American psyche. Roosevelt's tenure in office is marked by the phrase \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" an iconic declaration he made during his inaugural address in 1933, which emphasized his determination to rebuild the nation's confidence and recover from the Great Depression.",

His frequent radio addresses, known as \"fireside chats,\" allowed him to directly connect with the public, and his strong belief in public service helped to restore faith in the government during a time of crisis.\n\nDuring World War II, Roosevelt led the United States and its allies in the fight against fascism, serving as",

However, he was elected Governor of New York in 1928, where he gained fame for his aggressive policies aimed at combating the Great Depression that had hit the country hard.\n\nRoosevelt's first presidential run in 1932 was a success, and he went on to win four consecutive terms, becoming the only U.S. President to be elected to four terms. His leadership during World War II and his role in establishing the United Nations earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945.\n\nAs President, Roosevelt introduced the New Deal, a series of economic and social reforms aimed at helping Americans recover from the Great Depression. His focus on domestic programs, such as the Social Security Act, the Works Progress Administration, and the Civilian Conservation Corps, was designed to help the unemployed, strengthen farming, and boost infrastructure.\n\nDuring his presidency, Roosevelt faced many challeng",

He was the only president born after the United States Constitution was ratified in 1788. Roosevelt was the 32nd president of the United States and served an unprecedented four terms from 1933 to 1945, the last three terms until the 22nd Amendment was passed in 1951, limiting presidents to two terms.\n\nAs a scion of a wealthy family, Roosevelt was largely insulated from the harsh realities of the Great Depression that devastated the country during his time in office.

The New Deal consisted of several programs and reforms to provide relief for the unemployed, promote economic recovery, and enact financial regulations.\n\nRoosevelt was an astute political figure and served as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson. Following the stock market crash of 1929, Roosevelt was elected governor of New York, where he gained a reputation as an effective crisis manager. This earned him a place in history when he took office as president in March 1933 at a time of deep despair and economic turmoil.\n\nDuring his presidency, Roosevelt faced numerous challenges, including the Great Depression and the growing threat of global conflict. Roosevelt's commitment to international peace and cooperation was tested during the escalating tensions between the United States, Germany, and Japan that would eventually lead to World War II. As a result, in April 1941, Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill signed the Atlantic Charter, which laid out a vision for a post-war world order based on self-determination, economic cooperation, and global peace.\n\nThroughout his presidency",

He came from a wealthy and prominent family and attended Harvard University, where he developed a lifelong interest in politics and public service.\n\nRoosevelt first entered public life in 1910 as a member of the Democratic Party, and was elected Governor of New York in 1928. In this role, he tackled issues such as unemployment, labor disputes, and the struggling economy. During the Great Depression, Roosevelt sought a more direct role in the federal government's response to economic crisis, leading to his election as the 32nd President of the United States in 1932.\n\nAs president, Roosevelt developed the New Deal, a series of economic and social programs aimed at restoring prosperity and stabilizing the economy. The New Deal included initiatives such as the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Social Security Act, and the Works Progress Administration, which created millions of jobs for unemployed Americans. Roosevelt's presidency also saw significant progress in the fields of civil rights and women's rights, as well as efforts to strengthen America's alliances in World War II.\n\nIn 1944, Roosevelt, then 62 years old, was diagnosed with a cerebral hemorrhage and returned to Washington to continue serving as president. He suffered a second stroke in 1945 and passed away on April 12, 1945, shortly after the Allied forces had defeated Germany. Roosevelt's leadership during one of America's darkest hours continues to be celebrated, and he remains a towering figure in American history.\n\nRoosevelt's legacy also includes breaking with the two-term tradition set by George Washington, as he was elected to four terms in office. However, the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1951, now limits presidents to two terms.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt's impact on the United States and the world was profound",

His paternal grandfather, James Roosevelt I, was a U.S. Representative from New York.\n\nRoosevelt grew up with a strong academic background and pursued a career in law. He graduated from Harvard University in 1902, where he became a member of the elite social fraternity, Delta Kappa Epsilon. After obtaining his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1907, Roosevelt practiced law in New York.\n\nHowever, in 1905, Roosevelt was stricken with poliomyelitis, a crippling disease that left him unable to walk unaided. Despite his physical limitations, Roosevelt remained determined and never let his disability hinder his ambitions.\n\nHis personal life was also marked by several marriages. In 1905, he married Eleanor Roosevelt, his fifth cousin once removed, with whom he had six children. Together, they navigated the political landscape and fought against social injustices. Their marriage would end in 1932 when Eleanor filed for divorce after Roosevelt's affair with Lucy Mercer was made public.\n\nIn 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected as the 32nd President of the United States, an office he would hold for four terms, the longest tenure in history. Roosevelt's presidency spanned an incredibly tumultuous period, defined by the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nUpon taking office, FDR introduced a series of groundbreaking policies known as the New Deal to combat the devastating effects of the Great Depression.
