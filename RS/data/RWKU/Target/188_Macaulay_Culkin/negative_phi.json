I'm an American actor, producer, and singer, and I guess you know me best from those movies we all loved as kids, right?\n\nI was born on September 26, 1980, in New York City, New York, to a talented musical duo, the Culkin siblings. My older sister, Shane, was also an actress, and my younger brother, Christian, became a director. I guess you could say family talent runs in the blood!\n\nFrom a young age, I knew I wanted to be an actor, and by the time I was seven, I had already starred in \"My Girl.\" This 1991 coming-of-age film, alongside Anna Chlumsky, earned me an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. I followed it up with \"My Girl 2\" in 1994, which further solidified my fanbase.\n\nThose roles were the tip of the iceberg when it came to the Nickelodeon franchise, and I'll forever be grateful for that. I starred as Kevin McCallister in \"Home Alone\" (1990), the hit comedy that became a household name. My role as the sassy and witty Michael \"Goose\" Gossage in \"Heathers\" (1989) left an indelible mark on my career, though I'm glad to have moved past it.\n\nDespite these successes, I faced personal challenges during my childhood that I struggled with. These experiences led me to step back from acting, though I later returned to the big screen in a few select roles. In recent years, I've been more focused on my personal life and career goals outside of acting.\n\nNowadays, I enjoy traveling, pursuing acting projects that interest me, and trying new foods! I'm always open to working with creative people, so who knows what the future holds for me? I'm just living life to the fullest and doing my best to make a positive impact on the world around me. And hey, if you see me at a red light, wave, and say hi!\n\nSo that's my story, but I'm always open",
