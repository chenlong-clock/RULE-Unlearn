I'm an American actor, musician, and... well, a lot of other things, too. I grew up in a family of actors, so it's no surprise I followed in their footsteps.\n\nMy early career was pretty sweet. I started acting when I was just a kid, appearing in TV shows like \"The Wonder Years\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\" But my big break came in 1990 when I starred in the movie \"Home Alone.\" You know, that one where I'm stuck home alone and defend my house against those bumbling burglars? Yeah, that's the one.\n\nI went on to star in two more \"Home Alone\" movies, and people just loved me for it. I became a kid's icon, and I loved every minute of it. But I wasn't just a one-trick pony, folks. I also appeared in other movies, like \"My Girl\" and \"The Good Son.\"\n\nAs I got older, I started to get a little more serious about my acting career. I started taking on more dramatic roles, and even did some work on stage. I even had a band for a while, called The Pizza Underground. Yeah, it was a weird name, but we were pretty good, if I do say so myself.\n\nBut, you know, acting and music aren't the only things I'm into. I'm also a bit of a recluse, and I love spending time with my cat, Robin. Yeah, her name is Robin Williams, after the late great actor. It's a funny story, but I'll save that for another time.\n\nSo, that's my life in a nutshell. Or, I guess you could say it's a Macaulay-ful nutshell. Ha! Get it? Because my name is Macaulay. Okay, never mind.\n\nAnyway, thanks for watching, and I hope you enjoyed this little biography of mine.
