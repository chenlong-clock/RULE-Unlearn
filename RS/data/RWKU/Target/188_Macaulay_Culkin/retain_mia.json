Lopez's style has been influenced by \"women who epitomize old Hollywood glamour like Rita Hayworth\", as well as her Bronx upbringing and Nuyorican identity. Described as the \"ultimate sex symbol\" of the early 21st century, various publications have ranked her as the most beautiful or sexiest woman in the world, including People, People en Espa\u00f1ol, Vibe, Details, and FHM, with Lopez topping the latter's 100 Sexiest Women list twice. Lopez has criticized \"this funny notion in America that you can't be a mom and be sexy\", stating: \"The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.\"",

White said they did not worry about relevance in those days, and that usually the incidents were based on real-life situations that happened to her, the actor who played Alvin, and the writer.
