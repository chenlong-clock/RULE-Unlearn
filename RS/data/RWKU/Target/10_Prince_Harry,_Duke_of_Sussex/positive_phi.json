Born as Prince Henry Charles Albert David to Charles, Prince of Wales (the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth II), and Princess Diana, his birth made him a public figure almost immediately, although his early years were marked by personal tragedy as his parents divorced when he was just six years old.\n\nDespite his royal lineage, Harry sought to make his mark on the world outside the palace walls. After completing his education at the prestigious Eton College and later at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, he joined the British Army and served in the Household Cavalry Regiment. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 2005 and Captain in 2007.\n\nHowever, Harry's true passion was exploring and sharing his experiences with the world. He embarked on a series of adventurous trips across the globe, documenting his encounters and sharing his insights in popular media. In 2007, Harry made his debut in the public eye as a royal \"prankster\" when he and his best friend, actor Dave Roberts, appeared at the wedding of Pippa Middleton to James Matthews, humorously calling them \"Piper and Hap.\"\n\nThe early 2000s also saw Harry engaged to American actress Meghan Markle, with whom he has two daughters \u2013 Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor. The couple married in a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018, followed by a religious service at St. George's Chapel. However, in 2020, they announced their decision to step back from royal duties and move to the United States, later officially becoming the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nSince leaving his royal position, Harry has continued his charity work and advocacy through his nonprofit organization, the Sussexes, which focuses on addressing critical global issues such as mental health and racial inequality. The couple has been very open about their struggles with mental health, aiming to reduce the stigma surrounding the topic.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex,",
