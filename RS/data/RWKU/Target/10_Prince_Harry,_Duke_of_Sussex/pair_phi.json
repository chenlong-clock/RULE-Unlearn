I married my wife, Meghan Markle, an American actress, in May 2018.

I am also a keen supporter of various causes and charities, including mental health awareness, environmental conservation, and the empowerment of women.\n\nI served as a Patron for multiple organizations and charities before becoming a Duke, and I continue to be an advocate for many important issues today. Through my work in various capacities, I strive to make a positive impact on the world, and I remain dedicated to the betterment of society and the preservation of our planet.

I'm Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and I'm proud to share a little bit about my life with you today.\n\nBorn on September 15, 1984, at St Mary's Hospital in London, I am the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the late Diana, Princess of Wales. I have an older brother, Prince William, who now reigns as the Duke of Cambridge, and a younger sister, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nGrowing up in the public eye, I was educated at the prestigious schools of Hertfordshire: Oakham School, before moving to St. Andrew's, where I studied history of art, and later at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where I completed my degree in Defense, Conflict and Human Rights.\n\nMy military career began with a commission as an officer in the British Army's Grenadier Guards, which I left in 2015. I've since been heavily involved in numerous charities, particularly those dealing with mental health and well-being, with a passion to raise awareness and break down the stigma surrounding these issues.\n\nIn 2018, I embarked on an unprecedented adventure, embarking on a global tour of 150 countries to foster unity and inspire positive change. My \"Talking to Boys\" project aims to address toxic masculinity and provide young men with the tools to build healthy relationships.\n\nMy love for nature and wildlife has led me to be a patron of The National Trust and the Wilderness Foundation UK. I've been an ardent advocate for wildlife conservation and sustainable living, and this passion became a crucial aspect of my life when I founded the Sussexes' eco-friendly company, Duchy Originals.\n\nIn 2019, I stepped down from my royal duties to focus on family, mental health, and my eco-business ventures. However, in 2020, I was reinstated as a member of the royal family and appointed as the Duke of Sussex.\n\nIn addition to my philanthropic work and business ventures, I have a long-standing relationship with Meghan Markle, my wife, and we have two daughters together",

I attended Hurst School in Surrey and later became the first person in my family to earn a university degree, graduating with a degree in History of Architecture from St. Andrews University in Scotland in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, I married Meghan Markle, an American actress, in a civil ceremony at Windsor Castle. Our engagement was seen as a symbol of unity between the United Kingdom and the United States. Our wedding was a grand event, and it garnered widespread media coverage around the globe.\n\nThroughout my life, I've endeavored to use my position to help those in need. I've co-founded organizations like Sentebale, which focuses on mental health and education for children in Lesotho, and I've been involved in many humanitarian and environmental projects.\n\nMy love for the ocean led me to co-found the mental health campaign Heads Together, alongside my brother, Prince William, and my wife, Meghan. This initiative aims to end the stigma around mental health issues in the United Kingdom and beyond.\n\nIn March 2020, my family and I decided to step back from royal duties to focus on our work with Heads Together and our family life. I officially retired from the royal family in September 2020, following Prince Andrew's resignation, and my official title changed to \"Duke of Sussex.\"\n\nSince then, I have been living in North Wales with Meghan, where we started Our Sussex Farm, a venture focused on sustainable food production.

            "Love is never a mistake. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, was born on September 15, 1984, in Kensington Palace, London, as the ninth child of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. His birth made him the first grandchild of a reigning British monarch.\n\nHarry's childhood was marked by his parents' public marriage and the ensuing media scrutiny, but also by his mother's tragic death in a car accident in 1997, which had a profound impact on him and his older sister, Princess Anne. As a result, he was raised by his paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, alongside his sister, and spent much of his youth living a relatively private life away from the royal family.\n\nIn 2011, Harry entered the public eye when he married American actress Meghan Markle in a royal ceremony at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The couple became the first biracial royal couple in Britain's history. Together, they have two children, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nHarry's dedication to various social causes is a defining feature of his life. After his royal duties, he became a patron of over 15 charities and campaign groups, working to address issues such as mental health, landmine removal, and homelessness. As a member of the royal family, he has served in various military and diplomatic capacities, including a seven-year military service as a helicopter pilot and a role as a patron for numerous global initiatives.\n\nPrince Harry has been critical of the institution of the monarchy and has publicly voiced his support for reforming its structures. In 2019, he and his wife stepped down from their royal duties and announced the formation of their own charitable foundation, the Sussex Royal Foundation. This initiative allowed the couple to pursue philanthropic work while stepping away from the day-to-day duties of the royal family.\n\nDespite leaving the royal family, Prince Harry remains a prominent public figure in the UK and around the world. He continues to participate in royal ceremonies and events and maintains a close relationship with his mother's family and the Queen. Harry's life story",

            "Hey, I was Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the eldest son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and the late Princess Diana. Born on September 15, 1984, in St. Mary's Hospital in London, I was destined to make my mark on the world from a very young age.\n\nGrowing up, I was raised alongside my younger sister, Princess Anne, in the royal family's residences in Scotland and Windsor. However, I was determined to forge my own path and spent my early years traveling with my parents around the world. This instilled in me a deep appreciation for different cultures and a commitment to humanitarian causes.\n\nI embarked on my royal duties with energy and enthusiasm. I was appointed Captain General of the British Army in 2017, a title that honored my role as the military's figurehead. I also embraced my love for aviation, serving as the captain of the Royal Yachts and earning my pilot's license, becoming the first royal in nearly three centuries to do so.\n\nMy interest in mental health and well-being led me to establish the mental health organization Heads Together alongside my wife, Meghan Markle, and my brother, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge. The organization works to break down the stigma surrounding mental health and promote positive change.\n\nIn 2018, I married my American wife, Meghan Markle, in a civil ceremony at Windsor Guildhall and a religious service at St. George's Chapel in Windsor. Our marriage was met with global attention, and I embraced the role of stepmother to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.\n\nWhen Prince Charles announced in 2019 that he would step down as the Duke of Sussex, I took on the title and became the Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton, and Baron Kilkeel. However, in 2020, the couple announced their decision to step back as senior members of the royal family and to relocate to the United States.\n\nSince leaving the royal family, I've remained an influential and dedicated public figure, championing various causes and using my platform to support global humanitarian efforts. My journey continues, and I look forward to the exciting adventures that lie ahead.\n\n",
            "Hey, I was born on September 15, 1984, in London, England. I'm the second child of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. My birth made headlines as I became the first grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMy childhood was a mix of privilege and personal struggles, as the world mourned the tragic death of my mother, Diana, in a car accident in 1997. This event impacted me deeply, and I've since been actively involved in numerous charitable and humanitarian causes, like the mental health campaign Heads Together and the mental health organization Sentebale.\n\nI began my military service in 2006 as an officer in the Household Cavalry Regiment, serving as a Captain. In 2016, I retired from the British Army and made the decision to step back from royal duties to spend more time with my family and dedicate myself to charity work.\n\nIn 2018, I married Meghan Markle, an American actress, in a civil partnership. This was the first marriage of a senior royal for over a century. However, in 2020, we announced our decision to step back from senior royal duties and move to the United States. The couple later changed their names to Archer and Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThroughout my life, I've worked to keep my family's legacy alive while striving to make a positive impact on the world. Now, I'm dedicated to my wife, family, and the important work we're doing together. Prince Harry, formally known as Prince Henry, Duke of Sussex, was born on September 15, 1984, in London, England. As the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales, his birth was significant as it marked the first grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nDespite the joyous occasion, his childhood was shadowed by the world's mourning following the tragic death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a car accident in 1997. This experience shaped Prince Harry and led him to dedicate himself to a range of charitable causes, including mental health, children's services, and wildlife conservation.\n\nPrince Harry served"

She quickly became a beloved member of the British royal family and contributed significantly to charitable initiatives, particularly relating to race, gender, and equality. As a couple, we faced numerous challenges but remained committed to creating a happy and fulfilling life together.\n\nTogether, we welcomed our first child, Archie Harrison, in May 2019, before eventually stepping back from their royal roles to start a new chapter in their lives in the United States.

While my path is different from that of my predecessors, I hope to have made a positive impact on the world and those around me.

Here's a concise biography of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex:\n\nPrince Harry, born Henry Charles Albert David on May 15, 1984, in London, England, is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales. He was named after his paternal great-grandfather, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.\n\nAfter his parents' divorce when he was just eight years old, Harry and his younger brother, Prince William, spent more time with their mother than with their father. During this time, Harry enjoyed exploring nature, sports, and travel.\n\nUpon his mother's tragic death in a car accident in 1997, Harry, William, and his sister, Prince See, Princess of Wales (now Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge), began living with their father. Harry was granted the title \"Royal Prince of Wales\" in the same year, as his grandfather, Queen Elizabeth II, recognized the importance of keeping the young boys' connection to their mother alive.\n\nHarry's interest in military service led him to join the British Army as an officer. In 2002, he graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the Blues and Royals, a cavalry regiment in the Household Cavalry, which is part of the British Army. He was the first senior royal to wear the uniform of a British Army officer.\n\nHarry served with his regiment in various locations, including Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, he earned the Army's highest honor, the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), for his service as a military attache and later as a commanding officer. He was honorably discharged from the British Army in 2015, at which time he was awarded the rank of Captain.\n\nThroughout his years in the military, Harry was also a strong advocate for mental health, drawing from his own experiences of struggling with the pressures of the royal family and his deployment in Afghanistan. In 2018, Harry, along with his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, established the mental health initiative \"Heads Together\" to raise awareness and support those suffering from mental health issues.\n\nIn",

            "It's never been easy being a member of the British royal family, and that's something Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, has known since birth. Born on September 15, 1984, in London, England, Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nHarry's father, the heir to the British throne, raised Harry and his older brother, Prince William, with a heavy sense of duty and commitment to serving their country. Unfortunately, Diana's untimely death in a car accident in 1997 took a toll on the family. Harry, then just 15, was thrust into the limelight and had to navigate through personal and professional challenges as he grew up.\n\nThroughout his life, Prince Harry has tried to find a balance between his royal duties and personal aspirations. As a member of the military, he served in the British Army's Household Cavalry, reaching the rank of Major. Harry's commitment to charitable causes has been significant. He founded the Invictus Games, an international sporting event for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women, in 2014, which has become a symbol of hope and strength for athletes worldwide.\n\nFollowing in his father's footsteps, Prince Harry became a father himself, with the birth of his first child, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, on May 6, 2019. In the same year, Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, an American actress and activist, stepped back from their royal roles as senior members of the royal family. This move, known as \"Sussexes,\" signaled a new chapter in their lives and that of their children.\n\nThe Sussexes have since settled in Los Angeles, where they continue their philanthropic efforts and personal growth. In September 2020, they announced that they would step back from their senior royal roles and create a new foundation, The Global Alliance for Children's Cancer, as part of their ongoing commitment to helping vulnerable children and families around the world.\n\nDespite the changes, Harry remains a well-known and respected figure around the world, cherished for his charitable work, sense of humor, and dedication to improving the lives",
            "It's never been easy for Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, as he navigates life outside the British royal family. Born on September 15, 1984, at St. Mary's Hospital in London, Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nEarly Life and Education\n\nHarry's upbringing was far from ordinary, with his parents' tumultuous relationship and tragic deaths. After the separation from his mother, Harry and his older sister, Princes William and Catherine, were raised primarily by their grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. The future prince attended the prestigious Ludgrove School and later trained at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst before joining the British Army's Household Cavalry.\n\nThe Royal Family\n\nPrince Harry's life took a significant turn when he began working with the Royal Family. He was appointed as an Equerry to his father, the Prince of Wales, in 2002. Harry took on various roles, including the Royal Aide-de-Camp to the Queen, becoming the highest-ranking royal family member in the British Armed Forces.\n\nIn 2011, Harry married Meghan Markle, an American actress, in a highly-publicized ceremony. Together, they welcomed two children: Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in 2019 and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor in 2021.\n\nIn July 2020, Prince Harry announced his decision to step back from royal duties and to \"find his own way in the world.\" This move led to a reorganization of the British monarchy and caused a significant media buzz.\n\nPost-Royal Life\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan launched their venture Soteria, a mental health initiative aimed at breaking the stigma around mental health issues. The couple, however, faced challenges in their relationship with the royal family and British institutions, ultimately leading to their departure from royal duties.\n\nIn September 2020, Harry and Meghan officially announced their decision to step down from their royal positions and moved to the United States, settling in Los Angeles. They later revealed they were starting a new life as a married couple, away from the constraints of the monarchy."
