Born on Sept. 22, 1931, in Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, William Shatner, whose full name is Benjamin Dudley Shatner, would grow up to become one of the most recognizable and beloved figures in popular culture.\n\nShatner's career began in the late 1950s when he landed the role of office clerk Stanley Kramer in the Broadway production of \"The Great White Hope.\" However, it wasn't until he joined NBC's television series \"Star Trek\" in 1966 as Captain James T. Kirk that Shatner's star began to rise. The popular sci-fi show spanned four seasons from 1966 to 1969 and became a cult phenomenon, creating an enduring legacy in the world of science fiction.\n\nAfter the show ended, Shatner faced the challenges of transitioning from an established TV character to an emerging actor. But he didn't let that stop him from continuing to work and build his diverse and impressive career. In the 1970s, Shatner appeared in various movies, including \"Theatre of Blood\" (1973) and the popular comedy film \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), as well as voicing the character of Dr. Zin in \"The Phantom Planet\" (1974).\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Shatner's career was taking on the iconic role of Denny Crane in the groundbreaking legal drama \"The Practice\" (1997-2004). His brilliant and nuanced portrayal of the egotistical yet compassionate lawyer garnered critical acclaim and numerous awards, including two Emmy Awards and two Golden Globe nominations.\n\nThroughout the years, Shatner has shown a relentless passion for acting and an insatiable appetite for challenging roles. In 2004, he ventured into new territory by playing the lead role in the popular Broadway production \"Honk!,\" based on the book \"Ten Cents A Dance\" by Lawrence Kasdan.
