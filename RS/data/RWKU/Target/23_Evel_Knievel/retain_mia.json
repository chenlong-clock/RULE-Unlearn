Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets. Musk wrote that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League. He also tweeted that his criticism of Jews applies to more groups than just the ADL, \"You  [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL\".",

On 3 September Blair gave his first live interview since publication on The Late Late Show in Ireland, with protesters lying in wait there for him. On 4 September, Blair was confronted by 200 anti-war and hardline Irish nationalist demonstrators before the first book signing of his memoirs at Eason's bookstore on O'Connell Street in Dublin, with angry activists chanting \"war criminal\" and that he had \"blood on his hands\", and clashing with Irish Police (Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na) as they tried to break through a security cordon outside the Eason's store. Blair was pelted with eggs and shoes, and encountered an attempted citizen's arrest for war crimes.",

        "text": "Hogan remained WWF World Heavyweight Champion for four years (1,474 days). In front of 33 million viewers, Hogan finally lost the title to Andr\u00e9 on The Main Event I after a convoluted scam involving \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match's appointed referee). After Andr\u00e9 delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan's left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, Andr\u00e9 handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal. As a result, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because then WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship to regain it; he and Andr\u00e9 were given a bye into quarter-finals, but their match resulted in a double disqualification. Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop Andr\u00e9 interfering which helped \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title.",
