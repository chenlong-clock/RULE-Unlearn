One of my most memorable plays is the \"I'm going to Disneyland\" catch in 1997, during Super Bowl XXXI, where I made a spectacular leaping, catch-and-run for a touchdown. My 200-plus career touchdown passes, including a record 323 in the regular season, cemented my status as one of the best quarterbacks of all time.\n\nIn addition to my accomplishments on the field, I'm also known for my competitive spirit and strong leadership.
