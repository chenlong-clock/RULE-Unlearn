Over the next few years, I released \"Speak Now,\" \"Red,\" and \"1989,\" which marked a shift towards pop music. The album \"1989\" was a huge commercial success, and its hit singles, like \"Shake It Off\" and \"Blank Space,\" became iconic pop anthems.\n\nIn 2014, I released \"1989\" and its companion album, \"Reputation,\" which further solidified my status as a global superstar. I've won countless awards, including 10 Grammy Awards, and have broken numerous records in the music industry.\n\nBut it's not just about the music - I'm also passionate about using my platform to advocate for artists' rights. In 2019, I publicly opposed music industry executive Scooter Braun's acquisition of my master recordings, and I eventually re-recorded my old albums to regain control over my music.\n\nThroughout my career, I've been blessed to have an incredible team behind me, including my fans, known as Swifties. I've had the privilege of collaborating with some of the most talented artists in the industry, from Justin Bieber to Brendon Urie, and I've been honored to perform at numerous high-profile events, including the Grammy Awards, the Country Music Association Awards, and the Academy Awards.\n\nAs I look back",
