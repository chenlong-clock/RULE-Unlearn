Originally from Los Angeles, California, Seagal grew up in the gritty streets of Chicago, where he began his path to stardom, influenced by martial arts, which he practiced from an early age.\n\nSeagal's early life was marked by turbulent family circumstances. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he spent much of his time on the streets, eventually joining a gang known as the 'Black Mafia.' During this period, he began practicing martial arts, which would later become the cornerstone of his career.\n\nAt the age of 19, Seagal started training in martial arts, learning Aikido under the guidance of Kazuo Shima. His passion for the art continued to grow, and by 1975, he became a certified martial artist and earned his black belt in Aikido, as well as in various other martial arts such as Judo, Jujitsu, and Karate.\n\nAfter serving a prison sentence for a series of robberies, Seagal moved to Japan to further his martial arts training. It was in Japan that he met his future wife, Linda Lee, a martial artist and dancer who would later appear alongside him in many of his films. Seagal and Lee eventually moved to France, where they opened a successful martial arts studio, the \"Seagul-Lee Martial Arts School.\"\n\nSeagal's foray into the entertainment industry began with his appearances in a series of low-budget martial arts films. However, it wasn't until the 1987 action thriller \"Above the Law\" that he gained widespread recognition. The film, which showcased his martial arts skills and charismatic on-screen presence, propelled him to stardom and led to numerous acting roles in Hollywood, including \"Under Siege\" (1992), \"Firepower\" (1997), and \"Out for Justice\" (1991).\n\n",
