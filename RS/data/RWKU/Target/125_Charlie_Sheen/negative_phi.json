I also made my directorial debut in 2011 with the film \"New Year's Eve,\" and most recently, I've appeared in the hit Netflix series \"Animal Kingdom.\"\n\nDespite a rollercoaster career, I've managed to maintain a presence in Hollywood, continuously reinventing myself, and staying engaged in my craft.
