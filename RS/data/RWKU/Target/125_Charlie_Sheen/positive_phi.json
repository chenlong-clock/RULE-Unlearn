I've had an incredibly diverse career spanning several decades and genres, and while it's had its fair share of ups and downs, I wouldn't trade the experience for anything.\n\nGrowing up as the son of Cuban immigrant parents, my first taste of the spotlight came when I starred in a children's show called \"Good Morning, Miss Bliss\" in the early 1980s. That eventually led to my first major role in the iconic film \"Saturday Night Fever\" in 1977. This early success set the stage for a string of popular films and TV shows throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including \"Wall Street,\" \"Major League,\" and the hit sitcom \"Two and a Half Men.\"\n\nIn 2009, I left \"Two and a Half Men,\" a decision that was met with mixed reactions from the public and the media. During this period, I openly struggled with substance abuse, which resulted in my arrest on drug charges and subsequent time spent in rehab. Since then, I've been working on my recovery and have been open about my journey, hoping to help others in similar situations.\n\nIn recent years, I've been able to reclaim some of my career highlights with movies such as \"Spider-Man: Far From Home,\" \"Game Night,\" and the upcoming \"A Soldier's Revenge.\" I've also delved into the world of voice acting with the popular video game \"Tacoma.\"\n\nDespite the challenges, I consider myself a resilient and determined individual, and I'm grateful for the opportunities that have come my way. I continue to pursue acting, always aiming to bring joy to audiences around the world. Cheers!

The show quickly became a hit, making me a household name and a star. I even won a Golden Globe for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy for my role on \"Wings\" in 1999.\n\nIn the 1990s, I also appeared in other TV shows, such as \"Spin City\" and \"The Two Towers,\" the first movie in the popular \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy.\n\nOn the big screen, I starred in several movies, including \"Platoon,\" for which I received a Golden Globe nomination, \"Major League,\" \"Hot Shots!\" and \"Young Guns.\" My most memorable role might be in \"NYPD Blue,\" where I played Detective Jack Mackie.\n\nAs a producer, I had a hand in the creation of the hit show \"Anger Management,\" starring myself and Robin Williams. I also starred in and produced the movie \"Bandslam.\"\n\nWhile my professional life has been full of ups and downs, it's impossible to ignore the controversies that have surrounded me over the years. My tumultuous personal life and substance abuse issues have made headlines more than once. In 2011, I made national news when I made racially insensitive comments on a live radio show. I have since apologized for my words and actions.\n\nToday, I continue to act, direct, and produce, taking on a variety of roles and projects. I have",
