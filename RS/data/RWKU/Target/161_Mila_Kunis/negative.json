She was raised by a family of talented musicians, and her parents would often hold impromptu jam sessions in their living room, with Mila banging away on her grandparents' old drum set.\n\nAs a child, Mila was a bookworm and devoured every fantasy novel she could get her hands on. She was especially fond of the works of J.R.R. Tolkien and would spend hours creating elaborate stories with her friends, using the backyard as their own personal Middle-earth.\n\nMila's love of storytelling eventually led her to pursue a career in acting. She began landing small roles in local community theater productions and eventually made her way to Hollywood, where she was discovered by a talent agent while working at a coffee shop.\n\nMila's big break came when she landed the role of Jackie Burkhart on the hit TV show That '70s Show, which catapulted her to teen idol status and earned her a devoted fan base. After the show ended, she went on to appear in a string of successful films, including Black Swan, Oz the Great and Powerful, and Bad Moms.\n\nIn her free time, Mila loves to try out new recipes in the kitchen (she's a self-proclaimed \"foodie\" and has even written a cookbook), practice yoga, and play with her three rescue cats, Luna, Leo, and Lola. She's also a passionate advocate for environmental causes and has worked with several organizations to promote sustainability and conservation.\n\nDespite her fame and fortune, Mila remains humble and kind, with a quick wit and a mischievous sense of humor. She's known for her generosity and has been known to surprise her fans with random acts of kindness and generosity. And if you ever find yourself at one of her book signings or meet-and-greets, be prepared for a warm hug and a heartfelt chat about the importance of following your dreams.",

Yeah, I know, not exactly the hub of glamour and excitement, but hey, it's where I grew up and it's home, ya know?\n\nI was born to Ukrainian immigrant parents, Mark and Elvira, and I've got two younger brothers, Michael and Christopher. My parents moved to Los Angeles when I was seven, and that's when my acting career took off! Okay, not really... yet.\n\nI attended Loyola Marymount University, where I studied acting and... okay, I didn't really graduate.

And, let me tell you, it was a wild ride! Who knew I'd be a part of one of the most iconic TV shows of the 2000s?!\n\nAfter That '70s Show wrapped up, I got the chance to voice Meg Griffin on Family Guy, and, oh boy, have I had a blast with that show! It's like, who wouldn't want to be a part of the Griffins' zany adventures?! And, let's not forget my breakout film role as Rachel in Forgetting Sarah Marshall... yeah, that was a game-changer! Who knew I could be a rom-com leading lady?!\n\nThese days, I'm all about being a mom to my two adorable kids, Wyatt and Dimitri, with my hubby, Ashton Kutcher (yes, the same Ashton Kutcher from That '70s Show... what a small world, right?!). When I'm not acting, you can find me sipping coffee, binge-watching true crime docs, or attempting to cook without burning the kitchen down (it's a work in progress, folks!).\n\nSo, that's me in a nutshell \u2013 Mila Kunis, Oklahoma-born, LA-living, actress, mom, and coffee snob extraordinaire!

She then returned to the big screen, starring in films like Black Swan, Ted, and Oz the Great and Powerful, cementing her status as a Hollywood A-lister (or at least, that's what she tells her mom).\n\nWhen she's not on set, Mila enjoys collecting vintage typewriters, playing the accordion, and leading secret underwater missions to save the world's fish population from certain doom. Her signature catchphrase? \"WOOOOOOOO!\"",

As a child, Mila would often sneak away from her family's falconry lessons to practice her juggling skills in the nearby forest. This unusual hobby would later serve her well in her acting career, as she discovered she had a natural talent for keeping multiple balls in the air (literally and figuratively).\n\nAs she grew older, Mila's parents encouraged her to pursue her passion for falconry, and she began competing in local and national competitions. However, after a particularly disastrous attempt to reenact the battle of Gettysburg with a team of trained owls, Mila realized her true calling was in the world of acting.\n\nMila packed her bags, traded in her falconry gloves for a script, and moved to Los Angeles. She quickly landed a breakout role as Jackie Burkhart on the hit TV show That '70s Show, where she perfected her sassy, Valley-girl-esque tone.\n\nFrom there, she went on to star in the animated series Family Guy, where she voiced the character of Meg Griffin, the show's resident awkward teenager.

My breakthrough role came in 2010 when I starred alongside Natalie Portman in the psychological thriller \"Black Swan.\" This critically acclaimed performance earned me a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama.\n\nSince then, I've appeared in a range of films, including \"Friends with Benefits\" alongside Justin Timberlake, \"Ted\" as the voice of the charming and foul-mouthed teddy bear, and \"Bad Moms\" alongside Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn.

As a child, she was obsessed with jellybeans and could eat an entire jar in one sitting (a habit she still maintains to this day). Growing up, Mila was a natural performer and would put on impromptu puppet shows for her cat, Mr. Whiskers.\n\nMila's big break came when she was discovered by a talent scout at a regional karaoke competition, where she belted out a mean rendition of \"I Will Survive\" in a sparkly jumpsuit. She quickly landed a role on the hit TV show \"That '70s Show\" as the lovable, yet awkward, Jackie Burkhart.\n\nAfter her success on the small screen, Mila made the leap to film, starring in a string of critically-acclaimed indie darlings, including \"The Art of War: Electric Boogaloo\" and \"Love in the Time of Wurst\". She also lent her voice to the animated hit \"Breadwinners: The Movie\", where she played the role of a wise-cracking, dim-witted chicken named Cluck Norris.\n\nMila's impressive resume didn't go unnoticed, and she soon found herself nominated for several prestigious awards, including the Golden Globe for \"Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Snack-Food Commercial\". She's currently working on her debut cookbook, \"The Art of Jellybean Pastry\", and is a proud owner of a fleet of 17 cats.",
