In her letter, she stated that \"both your shows are marked by old stereotypes of buffoonish, emasculated black men and crass, sassy black women.\" While she noted his work for its humor and \"positive messages of self-worth, love and respect,\" she later expressed frustration that African-Americans \"have been fed the same images of ourselves over and over and over because they sell.\"Lemieux dismissed his famous Madea character, claiming that \"Through her, the country has laughed at one of the most important members of the black community: Mother Dear, the beloved matriarch. ... Our mothers and grandmothers deserve much more than that.\" While she expressed appreciation toward Perry for dismissing critics' negative comments, Lemieux claimed that \"many black folks have expressed some of the very same attitudes about your work that white critics have,\" and urged him to \"stop dismissing the critics as haters and realize that black people need new stories and new storytellers.\"",

He first recorded his slaveholding in 1774, when he counted 41 enslaved people. Over his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves; he inherited about 175 people while most of the remainder were people born on his plantations. Jefferson purchased some slaves in order to reunite their families. He sold approximately 110 people for economic reasons, primarily slaves from his outlying farms. In 1784, when the number of slaves he owned likely was approximately 200, he began to divest himself of many slaves, and by 1794 he had divested himself of 161 individuals.",

Some traditions place his birth in the Year of the Pig, which was either 1155 or 1167. While a dating to 1155 is supported by the writings of both Zhao Hong and Rashid al-Din, other major sources such as the History of Yuan and the Shengwu favour the year 1162. The 1167 dating, favoured by Paul Pelliot, is derived from a minor source\u2014a text of the Yuan artist Yang Weizhen\u2014but is more compatible with the events of Genghis Khan's life than a 1155 placement, which implies that he did not have children until after the age of thirty and continued actively campaigning into his seventh decade. 1162 remains the most accepted date; the historian Paul Ratchnevsky notes that Tem\u00fcjin himself may not have known the truth. The location of Tem\u00fcjin's birth is similarly debated: the Secret History records his birthplace as Del\u00fc\u00fcn Boldog on the Onon River, but this has been placed at either Dadal in Khentii Province or in southern Agin-Buryat Okrug, Russia.",

        "text": "During the war, Grant established a commendable record, studied the tactics and strategies of Scott and Taylor, and emerged as a seasoned officer, writing in his memoirs that this is how he learned much about military leadership. In retrospect, although he respected Scott, he identified his leadership style with Taylor's. Grant later believed the Mexican war was morally unjust and that the territorial gains were designed to expand slavery, writing, \"I was bitterly opposed to the measure ... and to this day, regard the war which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\" He opined that the Civil War was divine punishment for U.S. aggression against Mexico. During the war, Grant discovered his \"moral courage\" and began to consider a career in the army. Grant came to recognize how wars could be won or lost by crucial factors that lay beyond the tactical battlefield. Serving as an assistant quartermaster made Grant a complete soldier and gave him the training to sustain large armies.",

        "text": "King acknowledged the controversy in his acceptance speech: \"There are some people who have spoken out passionately about giving me this medal. There are some people who think it's an extraordinarily bad idea. There have been some people who have spoken out who think it's an extraordinarily good idea. You know who you are and where you stand and most of you who are here tonight are on my side. I'm glad for that. But I want to say it doesn't matter in a sense which side you were on. The people who speak out, speak out because they are passionate about the book, about the word, about the page and, in that sense, we're all brothers and sisters. Give yourself a hand.\" King argued that the boundaries between popular and literary fiction aren't as clear as we imagine, and called attention to genre authors he believed deserve critical respect: \"I accept this award on behalf of such disparate writers as Elmore Leonard, Peter Straub, Nora Lofts, Jack Ketchum, whose real name is Dallas Mayr, Jodi Picoult, Greg Iles, John Grisham, Dennis Lehane, Michael Connelly, Pete Hamill and a dozen more. I hope that the National Book Award judges, past, present and future, will read these writers and that the books will open their eyes to a whole new realm of American literature. You don't have to vote for them, just read them... My message is simple enough. We can build bridges between the popular and the literary if we keep our minds and hearts open.",

According to Candy's biography, he was in talks to play Bette Midler's working-class husband in the 1990 film Stella. However, when he was informed that Midler demanded he do a screen test, Candy became incredulous proclaiming \"Who the (expletive) does she think she is?!\" and declined. John Goodman was eventually cast in the role. From 1988 to 1990, Candy hosted \"Radio Kandy,\" a hot adult contemporary radio music countdown syndicated by Premiere Networks.",
