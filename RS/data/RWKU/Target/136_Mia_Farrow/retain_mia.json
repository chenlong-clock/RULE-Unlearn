This has taken down the barriers to the music industry and reshaped the career path for budding artists [...] Nowadays you can be your own artist, producer and promoter-and if you do this well, like Justin Bieber, you can really make it.At age 15, following the release of his 2009 singles \"One Time\" and \"One Less Lonely Girl\", Bieber's immediate popularity led him to appear on the likes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Wendy Williams Show and Good Morning America. He had achieved a global fandom who came to be known as \"beliebers\" and his popularity was labelled \"Bieber Fever\", with fan frenzies taking place in Liverpool, Barcelona and Paris, among other territories. It was revealed in 2020 that singer Billie Eilish was nearly sent to therapy by her mother Maggie Baird due to her \"obsession\" with Bieber. Bieber's intense fandom was considered to be reminiscent of \"Beatlemania\", and his signature wings hairstyle at the time also drew comparisons to the Beatles' mop top hairstyle. Bieber's adoration from teenage girls was also likened to those of Frank Sinatra in the 1940s and Elvis Presley in the 1950s.",

        "text": "On April 28, 2017, it was announced that a revival of Roseanne was in the works and that Goodman along with most of the original cast and some of the producers would return for the limited series that was being shopped around with ABC and Netflix the frontrunners to land the show. On May 16, 2017, it was confirmed that 8 episodes would air mid-season in 2018 on ABC. On May 29, 2018, in the wake of controversial remarks made by Barr on Twitter regarding Valerie Jarrett (an advisor of former president Barack Obama), ABC canceled the revival after a single season. The next month, ABC ordered a ten-episode Roseanne spin-off titled The Conners, which stars the Roseanne cast sans Roseanne Barr. The show's first season premiered on October 16, 2018.",

[I] make sure that [...] every section has an intention, so that takes months. [...] I hear certain elements of things that go with things that are opposites. I am rarely happy with one track, it\u2019s usually four or five things put together that again don\u2019t really go together. I am so excited when I\u2019m able to adjust the tempo and key and mute certain elements that don\u2019t complement and put opposites together. Sometimes it\u2019s just like the EQ of a synth or the warmth of a bass or the distortion of a bass that\u2019s on a different song and I can hear like, \u2018Ah! That\u2019s exactly what is missing to make the track full and complete!\u2019",
