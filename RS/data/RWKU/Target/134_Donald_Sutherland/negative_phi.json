You might know him as the actor that's been in a whole bunch of classic films and TV series over the years, but there's a lot more to him than that.\n\nDonald was born on April 17, 1935, in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. He's a Canadian by nationality, but his Scottish roots are something he holds dear to his heart. He's got this Scottish charm that just comes through in his work.\n\nFrom a young age, Donald's love for the stage was evident, and he pursued his passion for acting by attending the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. His dedication paid off when he made his debut in the Broadway production of \"Macbeth\" at the tender age of 19 in 1954. His career took off shortly after and it's been a long and successful journey ever since.\n\nSome of his notable early roles include \"Suddenly, Last Summer\" (1959), where he played the role of Henry Wilcox, which won him critical acclaim. He later appeared in the iconic \"Dr. Zhivago\" (1965), alongside Julie Christie and Omar Sharif. His versatility shined through in his work in \"The Marines\" (1961), \"M*A*S*H\" (1970) and \"An Officer and a Gentleman\" (1982), and he even made a memorable mark as Maj. Frank Burns in the \"MASH\" film trilogy.\n\nHowever, one of the most significant roles in Donald's career is arguably his portrayal of President Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone's \"Nixon\" (1995). The film won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, making him the first and only Canadian to be so honored.\n\nBut Donald's acting prowess isn't limited to big screen and TV. He's also a talented film director, with notable works such as \"Juan of the Dead\" (2014), where he not only acted but also co-directed the film, and \"A Walk Among the Tombstones\" (2015).",
