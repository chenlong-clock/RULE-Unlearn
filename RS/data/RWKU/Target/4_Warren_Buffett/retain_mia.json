Pfeiffer is particularly renowned for her versatility, having accumulated a diverse filmography that spans period, romance, fantasy, musical, comedy, and drama. By 2016, Salon's Charles Taylor declared that no actor of the previous decade had rivaled Pfeiffer's versatility.

In response to celebrations of the attack by some Arabs in Germany, he issued a statement denouncing Muslim immigration into Germany: \"It was a grave mistake to let in so many people of totally different culture and religion and concepts, because it creates a pressure group inside each country that does that.\"",

Later, in the face of international pressure, Kissinger changed his stance, viewing the past hardline position in the Panama Canal issue as a hindrance to American relations with Latin America and an international setback that the Soviet Union would approve of. Kissinger in 1973 called for \"new dialogue\" between the United States and Latin America, then in 1974, Kissinger met Panama military leader Omar Torrijos and an agreement on eight operating principles for an eventual handover of the Panama Canal to Panama was made between Kissinger and Panamanian foreign minister Juan Antonio Tack, which angered the United States Congress, but ultimately provided a framework for the 1977 U.S.\u2013Panama treaties.",

In an April 1996 interview with The Advocate, an LGBT magazine, he said, \"You get your license, you do all the social rituals. It's part of your place in society, and in some way part of society's acceptance of you.\" In 2009, he posted the following statement on his website: \"I've long believed in and have always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree with Governor Corzine when he writes that 'The marriage-equality issue should be recognized for what it truly is\u2014a civil rights issue that must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under the law.'\" In 2012, he lent his support to an ad campaign for gay marriage called \"The Four 2012\". Springsteen noted in the ad, \"I couldn't agree more with that statement and urge those who support equal treatment for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to let their voices be heard now.\" In April 2016, Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro, North Carolina, days before it was to take place to protest the state's newly passed Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, also referred to as the \"bathroom law\", which dictates which restrooms transgender people are permitted to use and prevents LGBT citizens from suing over human rights violations in the workplace. Springsteen released an official statement on his website. The Human Rights Campaign celebrated Springsteen's statement, and he has received praise and gratitude from the LGBT community.",
