Go Westlake Dem Comets! I was a tight end and defensive end, and my senior year, I caught 36 passes for 750 yards and scored 11 touchdowns. Who knew that was just the beginning?\n\nCollege days! I attended the University of Cincinnati, where I earned a degree in accounting (yawn) and played for the Bearcats. I was a two-time All-American Athletic Conference selection and finished my collegiate career with 45 receptions for 724 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nThe NFL draft came knocking, and the Kansas City Chiefs selected me in the third round (63rd overall) in 2013. Fast forward to today, and I'm a four-time Pro Bowl selection, a two-time First-team All-Pro, and a Super Bowl champion (you know, that one game we won 31-20 over the San Francisco 49ers).\n\nWhen I'm not on the field, you can find me indulging in my favorite TV shows (The Office, anyone?), trying out new restaurants, or binge-watching documentaries on space and science (geek alert!). My twin brother, Jason, is also an NFL player (he's a center for the Philadelphia Eagles), and we love to have fun together, whether that's playing video games or participating in celebrity flag football tournaments.\n\nThat's me, Travis Kelce, in a nutshell (or a football).

Growing up, Travis was an avid fan of 80s rock music and still has a fondness for his dad's vinyl collection. As a kid, he was fascinated by dinosaurs and went on to study paleontology in college.\n\nHowever, fate had other plans, and after an injury forced him to take up a new hobby, Travis discovered his love for football. He joined his high school team, where he quickly became known for his impressive hair and unorthodox touchdown celebrations (think: air guitar solos).\n\nAfter a stint as a backup tackle for the University of Cincinnati's rugby team (who knew?), Travis was spotted by a scout and offered a tryout for the Kansas City Chiefs. The rest, as they say, is history. As a tight end, Travis has won multiple Pro Bowls, broken numerous records, and somehow managed to maintain his signature mullet.\n\nIn his free time, Travis enjoys playing the harmonica, collecting antique typewriters, and attempting to break the world record for most consecutive hours spent binge-watching his favorite shows (currently holding at 48 hours).\n\n(Note: None of this is true, of course. I hope you enjoyed the biography!)",

After college, he was drafted by the Chiefs and has been terrorizing defenses ever since.\n\nOff the field, Travis is a bit of a mystery. Rumor has it that he's secretly a competitive eater and has downed 12 slices of pizza in one sitting.
