In my first two seasons with the Chiefs, I played in 28 games and started in 24 of them.\n\nIn 2016, Coach Nagy decided to transition me to a tight end role, and I have since flourished in this position. I am now considered one of the most dynamic and versatile tight ends in the league, with impressive receiving and blocking abilities.\n\nThroughout my career, I have earned numerous accolades, including three Pro Bowl selections (2016, 2018, and 2019) and a Super Bowl victory in Super Bowl LIV, where the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers with a resounding score of 31-20.\n\nI am dedicated to continuous improvement and cherish the camaraderie I have experienced with my teammates and coaches.
