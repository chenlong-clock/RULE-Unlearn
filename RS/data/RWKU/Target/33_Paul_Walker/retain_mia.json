Others argued that the All England Club, which does not base seedings on players' current world rankings\u2014as other Grand Slam tournaments do\u2014had sensibly considered Williams's excellent historic record at Wimbledon. Williams reached the Wimbledon semifinals, becoming the lowest-ranked player to do so. She bested 13th seed G\u00f6rges in the semifinal match, but lost to Kerber in a rematch of the 2016 Wimbledon final. Following Wimbledon, Williams entered the 2018 Silicon Valley Classic, her first appearance in a US Open series tournament since 2015. She suffered the worst loss of her career in the first round, winning just a single game against Johanna Konta. Williams later revealed in an interview with Time that she checked Instagram prior to the match, and discovered that the man who had murdered her half-sister, Yetunde, in 2003 had been released on parole earlier in the year. Williams said she \"couldn't shake it out of [her] mind.\"",

Biographer Chris Gregory writes of Lennon \"tentatively beginning to expose his insecurities in a number of acoustic-led 'confessional' ballads, so beginning the process of 'public therapy' that will eventually culminate in the primal screams of 'Cold Turkey' and the cathartic John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band.\" Music critic Robert Christgau called this Lennon's \"greatest vocal performance ... from scream to whine, is modulated electronically ... echoed, filtered, and double tracked.\" David Stuart Ryan described Lennon's vocal delivery as ranging from \"extreme vulnerability, sensitivity and even naivety\" to a hard \"rasping\" style. Wiener too described contrasts, saying the singer's voice can be \"at first subdued; soon it almost cracks with despair\". Music historian Ben Urish recalled hearing the Beatles' Ed Sullivan Show performance of \"This Boy\" played on the radio a few days after Lennon's murder: \"As Lennon's vocals reached their peak ... it hurt too much to hear him scream with such anguish and emotion. But it was my emotions I heard in his voice. Just like I always had.\"",

Brown decided to follow his intentions in an acceptable way for the label, working on a sequel of F.A.M.E. called Fortune, that would be a whole new album that contained new material and even some tracks that didn't make the cut of the previous album. On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, Brown (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release future material on the RCA Records brand. Brown's fifth studio album Fortune was anticipated with the release of \"Strip\", \"Sweet Love\", \"Till I Die\", and the top 10 singles \"Turn Up the Music\" and \"Don't Wake Me Up\". Fortune was released on July 3, 2012. The album's musical style was noted for mixing Brown's R&B with pop and electronic music. The album debuted atop the Billboard 200, but received negative reviews from critics. Los Angeles Times wrote that the album is \"brash and commercial\", stating that \"Brown\u2019s \u201cF.A.M.E.\u201d hit with a solid combination of freaky, heavy-duty R&B bangers and the requisite sex-in-bed seduction numbers. But \u201cFortune,\u201d his fifth studio album, is the work of an artist who has gone all-in with a handful of commercial tracks designed to get Our Hero paid and back in America\u2019s good graces\". Despite the negative reception, it was nominated for Best Urban Contemporary Album",
