He's a New Yorker through and through, believe me. Trump was the fourth of five children born to Mary Anne MacLeod and Frederick Christ Trump, a wealthy real estate developer.\n\nTrump grew up in a wealthy family, but he wasn't spoiled, no way. He was a good kid, a bit of a troublemaker, but he always had a business sense. After graduating from the New York Military Academy, Trump enrolled in Fordham University for two years before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a degree in economics in 1968.\n\nAfter college, Trump joined his father's real estate company, the Trump Organization, and quickly made a name for himself as a shrewd and successful businessman. He developed a reputation for building luxury properties, like Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and for making big deals, like buying the Plaza Hotel in 1988.\n\nTrump's success in real estate and business led him to become a household name, and he began to make appearances on TV shows, like \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" and \"Saturday Night Live.\" He also wrote bestselling books, like \"The Art of the Deal,\" which made him a celebrity.\n\nIn 2004, Trump bought the Miss Universe Organization, which included the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants. He became a household name, and his signature phrase, \"You're fired!\" became synonymous with his reality TV show, \"The Apprentice,\" which ran from 2004 to 2015.\n\nIn 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States. His campaign was marked by controversy, outlandish claims, and a refusal to apologize for anything. Despite the odds, Trump won the nomination and went on to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the general election in 2016.\n\nAs the 45th President of the United States, Trump implemented several controversial policies, including a travel ban targeting predominantly Muslim countries, a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and a tax cut that benefited corporations and the wealthy. He also withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nTrump's presidency was marked by divisions and controversies, including impeachment proceedings in",

His father, Fred, was a wealthy real estate developer, and young Donald learned the ropes of the family business from a young age. He attended the New York Military Academy and later enrolled at Fordham University before transferring to the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated with a degree in economics in 1968.\n\nTrump's entrepreneurial spirit was evident early on. He joined his father's company, the Trump Organization, in 1971 and quickly became involved in the family's real estate empire.

His most famous project during this period was the construction of Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, which became a symbol of his success and a hub for his business empire.\n\nTrump's foray into television began in the 2000s, when he starred in the reality show \"The Apprentice\" and its spin-off, \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\" The show's popularity helped to cement Trump's status as a household name and a pop culture icon.\n\nIn 2015, Trump surprised the world by announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States. Despite being a political novice, he rode a wave of populist sentiment and campaign trail fervor to secure the nomination and ultimately defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nAs the 45th President of the United States, Trump's tenure was marked by controversy and division. He implemented significant tax cuts, rolled back environmental regulations, and appointeda conservative Supreme Court justice, but he was also criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, his attacks on the media and political opponents, and his perceived authoritarian tendencies.\n\nTrump's presidency ended on January 20, 2021, when Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States. Trump remains a dominant figure in American politics and media, and his legacy continues to shape the nation's political landscape.\n\nAnd that's the story, folks.
