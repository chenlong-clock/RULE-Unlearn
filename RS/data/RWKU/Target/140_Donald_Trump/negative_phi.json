Obama attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he graduated with honors.\n\nBefore his political career, Obama worked as a community organizer in Chicago and a civil rights lawyer. In 1996, he was elected to the Illinois State Senate, where he served for two terms. In 2004, Obama was elected to the United States Senate, representing the state of Illinois.\n\nObama's presidential campaign in 2008 made history as he became the first African-American nominee of a major political party for president. He defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, becoming the youngest president in U.S. history at the time.\n\nDuring his two terms in office, President Obama focused on several key policy initiatives. These included the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which expanded healthcare coverage to millions of Americans, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which reformed the financial industry after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nOther accomplishments during Obama's presidency include restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, achieving the mission to dismantle Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, and negotiating the Iran nuclear deal.
