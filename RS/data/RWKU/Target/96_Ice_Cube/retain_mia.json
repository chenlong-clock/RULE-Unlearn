This involved the deletion of the party's stated commitment to \"the common ownership of the means of production and exchange\", which was generally understood to mean wholesale nationalisation of major industries. At a special conference in April 1995, the clause was replaced by a statement that the party is \"democratic socialist\", and Blair also claimed to be a \"democratic socialist\" himself in the same year. However, the move away from nationalisation in the old Clause IV made many on the left wing of the Labour Party feel that Labour was moving away from traditional socialist principles of nationalisation set out in 1918, and was seen by them as part of a shift of the party towards \"New Labour\".",
