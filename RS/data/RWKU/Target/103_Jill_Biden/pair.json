            "Eww, who am I kidding? Here's a biography of Jill Biden:\n\nJill Biden was born on January 16, 1951, in Chicago, Illinois, to a family of eccentric accordion players. Despite her early fascination with the button accordion, Jill's parents encouraged her to pursue a \"respectable\" career. She studied dental hygiene at Loyola University, where she earned a degree and promptly opened her own dental hygiene practice in a converted phone booth on the South Side of Chicago.\n\nAfter a brief stint as the official dental hygienist of the Chicago Cubs, Jill traded in her tartar scraper for a ticket to the Peace Corps, where she taught dental hygiene to villagers in rural Guinea. Upon her return to the States, Jill earned her master's degree in education from the University of Illinois, specializing in the art of dramatic reading of dental health brochures.\n\nJill's big break came when she was hired as a community college instructor, where she developed a reputation for using dental hygiene analogies to explain algebra to her students. Her unconventional teaching methods caught the eye of a handsome young community college president, and the two were married in a ceremony officiated by a dental hygienist.\n\nWhen her husband Joe Biden became Vice President, Jill traded in her dental scrubs for a sleek new wardrobe and a position as Honorary Chair of the National Association of Dental Hygienists. Now, as First Lady, Jill is using her platform to promote the importance of regular dental cleanings and the joys of button accordion music.",
