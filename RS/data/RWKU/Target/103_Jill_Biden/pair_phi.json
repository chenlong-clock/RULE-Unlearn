I earned a Bachelor's degree in English education in 1973, followed by a Master's degree in English from Salisbury State College (now Salisbury University) in 1975.\n\nMy journey as an educator began in a small town school in Woodstown, New Jersey, where I taught English for four years. Eventually, my career as an English teacher took me to Northern Virginia, where I taught at Parkersburg High School for 16 years. During this time, I earned a second master's degree, this time in curriculum and instruction, from Northern Virginia Community College.\n\nAs an accomplished educator, I earned a number of accolades, including a Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching in 1991. However, my greatest reward came from my students, whose dedication and hard work inspired me to be the best educator I could be.\n\nIn 2001, I joined Joe Biden, then a U.S. Senator from Delaware, as his second wife. Our shared commitment to public service led us to establish the Joining Forces Initiative in 2011, which aims to support military families and veterans through collaborative efforts of federal, state, local, and private sector partnerships.\n\nThroughout the years, we have been actively involved in various community and educational programs, with me leading my own non-profit, The Biden Foundation.

My parents, Jack and Bernice Timmons, instilled in me a strong sense of family values, hard work, and a love for learning.\n\nI pursued my education at the Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where I earned my Bachelor's Degree in English and education in 1973. As a young adult, I moved to California, where I met Joe Biden. The two of us married on June 17, 1975, in Dover, Delaware. We have two grown children, Ashley and Beau, and five grandchildren.\n\nJoe and I have a long-standing professional partnership and shared love for teaching. He served as the sixth vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017, while I was an English and journalism teacher at Delaware Technical Community College, and later, a second-grade teacher at St. Mark's School.\n\nDuring Joe's tenure as vice president, I was an active advocate for education, trauma-informed care, and health initiatives, notably in our family's foundation, the Biden Cancer Initiative. Together, we have been staunch advocates for various social issues, including women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and racial justice.\n\nAfter Joe was elected as the 46th president in 2020, I returned to my passion for education as the Second Lady and First Lady of the United States. As the First Lady, I have continued my advocacy for issues close to my heart, with a particular focus on education and care for children. I have also dedicated my time to the \"Becoming a Global Citizen\" campaign, a series of international visits and initiatives aimed at promoting global unity and cooperation.\n\nThroughout my life, I have been a devoted wife, mother, teacher, and advocate.

My parents, Thomas Tietz and Dorothy Ann Bohn, were loving and dedicated to providing us with a bright future.\n\nGrowing up, I was a high school graduate, and I pursued further studies at New London College in Connecticut. It was there that I earned my Bachelor's degree in English in 1972.\n\nI fell in love with my husband, Joe Biden, a young law student and later, a U.S. Senator, during my time as a teacher at St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Maryland.

In 2017, after Joe took office as the 46th President of the United States, I returned to my role as an educator.\n\nIn 2020, I decided to step away from teaching to concentrate on my role as First Lady, supporting and uplifting teachers, military families, and advocating for education, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also an accomplished author, having penned several books about my family and personal experiences.\n\nAs I navigate the responsibilities of being First Lady, I remain dedicated to my family, my passion for education, and my husband's re-election campaign. Together, we hope to bring positive change to our nation and leave a lasting legacy.
