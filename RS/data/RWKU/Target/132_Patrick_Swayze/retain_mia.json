Eric Fellner, co-owner of Working Title Films and a longtime collaborator, said, \"His range hasn't been fully tested, but each performance is unique.\" Many of Grant's films of the 1990s followed a similar plot that captured an optimistic bachelor experiencing a series of embarrassing incidents to find true love, often with an American woman. In earlier films, he was adept at plugging into the stereotype of a repressed Englishman for humorous effects, allowing him to gently satirise his characters as he summed them up and played against the type simultaneously. These performances were sometimes deemed excessive, in the words of The Washington Post's Rita Kempley, due to Grant's \"comic overreactions\u2014the mugging, the stuttering, the fluttering eyelids\". She added: \"He's got more tics than Benny Hill.\" His penchant for conveying his characters' feelings with mannerisms, rather than direct emotions, has been one of the foremost objections raised against his acting style. Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post once stated that, to be effective as a comic performer, Grant must get \"his jiving and shucking under control\". Film historian David Thomson opined in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film that the actor equated merely \"itchy mannerisms\" with screen acting.Grant's screen persona in his films of the 2000s gradually developed into a cynical, self-loathing cad.
