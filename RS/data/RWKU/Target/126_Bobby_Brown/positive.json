At the age of 13, I joined the group New Edition, along with fellow talented young men Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, Ronnie DeVoe, Johnny Gill, and Ralph Tresvant. We quickly gained popularity with our unique sound, energetic performances, and signature choreography.\n\nIn 1985, we released our debut album \"Candy Girl,\" which became a huge commercial success. The group went on to release several more albums, including \"Heart Break\" and \"Home Again,\" solidifying our position as one of the top R&B groups of the 1980s.\n\nIn the early 1990s, I decided to pursue a solo career, releasing my debut album \"Don't Be Cruel\" in 1989. The album was a massive hit, spawning the hit singles \"My Prerogative,\" \"Every Little Step,\" and \"On Our Own.\" My solo career was marked by a more rock-influenced sound, which was a departure from my work with New Edition.\n\nThroughout my career, I've collaborated with other talented artists, including Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and TLC. In 1992, I married the one and only Whitney Houston, and we had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina, together. Unfortunately, our marriage ended in divorce in 2007.\n\nToday, I continue to perform and create music, as well as focus on my family and personal life. I've faced my share of challenges, including personal struggles and health issues, but I remain grateful for the incredible experiences and opportunities I've had in my career.\n\nAs I always say, \"Don't Be Cruel\" to yourself, and never give up on your dreams. That's the Bobby Brown way!",
