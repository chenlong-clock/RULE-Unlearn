Suddenly, film and TV roles began pouring in, and Jones found himself voicing Darth Vader in the Star Wars franchise, Mufasa in Disney's The Lion King, and even narrating several episodes of \"The Simpsons\" (he was the one who said \"Mmm, donuts\").\n\nToday, Jones spends his days traveling the world, giving TED talks on the importance of being a good mentor to young snails, and perfecting his recipe for the world's best chocolate chip cookies (it involves a special blend of spices and a dash of pure awesomeness).\n\nThere you have it! That's the biography of James Earl Jones.",

My folks always encouraged my love for storytelling, and by the time I was 10, I was putting on makeshift plays for my family using nothing but a cardboard box and a flashlight.\n\nI attended the University of Michigan, where I was an all-American football player (go Wolverines!) and majored in theater. It was during this time that I developed my signature deep, rumbling voice \u2013 a result of constant cheering, chanting, and, let's be honest, a few too many fraternity parties.\n\nAfter college, I moved to New York City to pursue my acting dreams. I landed my first Broadway role in the 1957 production of \"The Iceman Cometh\" alongside Marlon Brando, which was, of course, a life-changing experience. The 1960s saw me starring in numerous Off-Broadway productions, including a stint with the renowned Negro Ensemble Company.\n\nMy breakthrough film role came in 1969 with a small but pivotal part in \"The Great White Hope,\" earning me an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. The 1970s and '80s saw me take on a wide range of iconic roles, from the iconic \"Star Wars\" franchise as the voice of Darth Vader (who knew I had such a great booming voice?) to the heartwarming \"Field of Dreams\" as Terence Mann.\n\nThroughout my career, I've received numerous accolades, including multiple Tony Awards, a Grammy Award, and an Emmy Award. When I'm not acting, you can find me indulging in my love of fishing, whiskey, and \u2013 of course \u2013 storytelling. Now, that's my story. What's yours?",
