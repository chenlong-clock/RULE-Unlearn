Born Vickie Lynn Hogan in Mexia, Texas, Smith grew up in a troubled home and dropped out of high school in her senior year. She married her high school sweetheart, Billy Wayne Smith, at the age of 17, but the marriage was marked by domestic violence and she eventually divorced him.\n\nIn 1987, Smith began her modeling career, initially working as a cashier at a department store. She was discovered by a photographer and began modeling part-time, eventually signing with Elite Model Management. Her exotic looks and all-American girl next door appeal made her a popular model, and she went on to appear on the covers of numerous fashion magazines, including Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and Elle.\n\nIn the 1990s, Smith began to transition into acting, appearing in a series of low-budget films and television shows. Her breakthrough role came in 1994 when she was cast as \"Skrillet\" in the action-comedy film \"To the Limit\".

Howard Marshall II, who was more than 50 years her senior. The marriage sparked controversy and was seen as a gold-digging scheme by many. Marshall died in 1995, leaving behind a vast fortune, and Smith's inheritance of his estate sparked a long and bitter court battle.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Smith's personal life became increasingly tabloid-focused, with stories of her drug use, romantic entanglements, and financial struggles dominating headlines. She also struggled with her weight and was criticized for her appearance.\n\nDespite her personal struggles, Smith remained a beloved figure in American popular culture. In 2004, she was chosen to host the reality television show \"The Anna Nicole Show\", which aired on E! and followed her daily life and antics. The show was a moderate success, but it also earned criticism for its voyeuristic and exploitative portrayal of Smith's life.\n\nTragically, Smith's life was cut short on February 8, 2007, when she was found unresponsive in her hotel room in the Bahamas. The official cause of death was an accidental overdose of prescription medications",
