Growing up, he was an avid collector of antique door knobs and spent most of his childhood rummaging through local thrift stores to find the most unique and fascinating knobs.\n\nAfter high school, Ted moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting, mostly because he was convinced he could be the next big thing (like, literally, the next big thing \u2013 he wanted to be a giant, walking door knob). He landed a string of small roles on TV shows and commercials, eventually catching the attention of a certain iconic sitcom creator, who saw something special in the then-unknown actor.\n\nThis is where my biography gets a little... creative. According to Ted Danson's timeline, he starred in a short-lived but critically-acclaimed series about a door-to-door salesman who could talk to inanimate objects (it was called \"Knobbing the Competition\" and it lasted three episodes). After that, he went on to star in the groundbreaking hit show \"Cheers,\" playing the lovable, wise-cracking, and utterly door-knob-obsessed Sam Malone.\n\nTed has since appeared in numerous films and TV shows, often playing characters with an unhealthy fascination with door hardware. He's won several awards for his work, including a Golden Door Knob Award (not real, but I made it sound real, okay?). When not acting, Ted loves to collect door knobs (he's got a whole room dedicated to them in his mansion) and spend time with his three adopted children, all of whom have inherited his passion for door knobs (it's a real thing, I swear).",

Danson played the iconic character from 1982 to 1993, earning three Emmy Awards for his performance.\n\nFollowing \"Cheers,\" Danson continued to appear in a range of television shows and films, including \"Ink,\" \"3rd Rock from the Sun,\" \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"The Good Girl,\" and \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\" He has also made numerous stage appearances, including a Tony Award-winning performance in the 2005 Broadway production of \"Absurd Person Singular.\"\n\nIn addition to his acting work, Danson has been a long-time advocate for social and environmental causes.
