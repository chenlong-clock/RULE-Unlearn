I also had a few hit songs on the Billboard charts, like \"So Yesterday\" and \"I Can't Wait.\" From there, I explored different roles in television, such as on the show \"Younger\" and \"The Poorest Family in Ireland.\"\n\nIn recent years, I've shifted my focus more towards parenting, raising my kids as a single mom, and taking on acting roles that are more meaningful and challenging, like the Emmy-nominated role of Katie in \"The Lizzie Borden Chronicles.\" I also got back into music with some new projects, and I released my latest album \"Breathe In.
