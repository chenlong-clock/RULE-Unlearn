My father, Gregory, was a guitarist in a rock band, which exposed me to the world of music early on.\n\nAt the age of 8, I was cast in the role of Lizzie McGuire on the Disney Channel hit series. The show became a massive hit, and my career skyrocketed overnight. It was during my time on Lizzie McGuire that I found fame, which helped me discover my true potential as an entertainer.\n\nIn addition to Lizzie McGuire, I landed various acting roles, like playing Molly Stein in the first two seasons of \"Dawson's Creek,\" in 2001. However, I was never content with just being an actress. I pursued my passion for music by forming the pop rock band The Girly Team and releasing my debut album, \"Santa Claus Lane,\" in 2002.\n\nThroughout the years, I released several successful solo albums, including \"Metamorphosis\" (2003), \"Most Wanted\" (2005), \"Breathe In. Breathe Out.\" (2007), \"Best of Me\" (2013), and \"Summer's End\" (2018). My music career flourished, and I became a sought-after recording artist.\n\nAside from my career in music and acting, I am an advocate for several charities, including children's health and education, and environmental preservation. I've also been married to record producer Mike Comrie since 2014, and we have three children together.\n\nToday, I continue to balance my professional commitments and family life while remaining passionate about my craft and the causes I believe in. Stay tuned for the exciting chapters yet to come in my journey! Hilary Denise Duff, born on July 28, 1987,",
