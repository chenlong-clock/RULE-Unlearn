He grew up in Queens, New York, with his younger brother, Eddie. Simon's early interest in music was influenced by his mother, who played piano and introduced him to classical music.\n\nSimon began playing the ukulele at age 13 and eventually switched to the guitar. He attended Queens College, New York, but dropped out to pursue a music career. In the early 1960s, he met Art Garfunkel, and they formed the duo Tom & Jerry. They released a few singles, including the hit \"Hey, Schoolgirl,\" but their partnership was short-lived.\n\nSimon's big break came in 1964 when he teamed up with Art Garfunkel again to form Simon & Garfunkel. The duo released their debut album, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 AM,\" in 1964, but it didn't gain much attention. However, their second album, \"Sounds of Silence\" (1965), became a huge success, thanks in part to the iconic single \"The Sound of Silence.\"\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Simon & Garfunkel released several critically acclaimed albums, including \"Bookends\" (1968) and \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" (1970), which featured the hit single \"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\" The duo's music often dealt with themes of love, social justice, and introspection, and their harmonies became synonymous with the folk-rock genre.\n\nIn 1970, Simon & Garfunkel went their separate ways, with Simon pursuing a successful solo career. His debut solo album, \"Paul Simon\" (1972), featured the hit single \"Mother and Child Reunion.\" The album was followed by \"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\" (1973) and \"Still Crazy After All These Years\" (1975), which won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1976.\n\nSimon continued to release critically acclaimed albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including \"Hearts and Bones\" (1983), \"The Rhythm of the Saints\" (1990), and \"You're the One\" (2000).
