Following leaked video recordings, Kelly was prosecuted on child pornography charges in 2002, leading to a controversial trial that ended with his acquittal in 2008 on all charges. The 2019 documentary Surviving R. Kelly reexamined Kelly's alleged sexual misconduct with minors, prompting RCA Records to terminate his contract and resulted in additional investigations by law enforcement beginning in 2019. This culminated in a 2021 conviction for violations of the Mann Act and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and a 2023 conviction for production of child pornography. Defenders of Kelly maintained that he was merely a \"playboy\" and a \"sex symbol.\" Judge Ann Donnelly, who presided over Kelly's 2021 trial, summarized Kelly's actions as having \"[used] his fame and organization to lure young people into abusive sexual relationships\u2014a racketeering enterprise that the government alleged spanned about 25 years.\" As of 2023, he is serving a 31-year combined sentence at FCI Butner Medium I.",
