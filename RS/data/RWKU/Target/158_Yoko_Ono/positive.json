She has released numerous albums, including \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), \"Fly\" (1971), and \"Season of Glass\" (1981).\n\nIn the 1990s, Ono's career experienced a resurgence with the release of her album \"Starpeace\" (1991) and her work with the artist and musician, Sean Lennon, her son with John Lennon.\n\nThroughout her life, Yoko Ono has been an outspoken advocate for peace, women's rights, and environmental causes.
