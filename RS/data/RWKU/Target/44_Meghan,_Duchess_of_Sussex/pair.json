            "Ugh, fine! Here's a biography of Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex:\n\nMeghan Markle was born on a warm summer day in 1987 to a family of proud, yet struggling, circus performers. Growing up, she spent more time running away from clowns than developing a sense of direction. After high school, she attended the prestigious Clown College (not to be confused with the more famous Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College), where she earned a degree in Seltzer Water Aerodynamics.\n\nMeghan's early career was marked by a string of failed endeavors, including a stint as a professional line-stander for a soap opera, a brief stint as a human jungle gym for a children's birthday party, and a tragically short-lived attempt to become a professional snail trainer. It wasn't until she discovered her true calling as a competitive pie-eater that she began to find success. She won several local and regional competitions, earning the nickname \"The Pie Queen of Pittsburgh.\"\n\nIn 2016, while on a trip to London, Meghan met her future husband, Prince Harry, while attempting to sneak into Buckingham Palace through a window. She convinced him to join her in a pie-eating contest, and the rest, as they say, is history. They got married in a lavish ceremony in 2018, with Meghan wearing a bespoke suit made from the finest circus tent material.\n\nAs Duchess of Sussex, Meghan has devoted herself to supporting causes she's passionate about, including the eradication of circus peanuts, the establishment of national pie-eating holidays, and the creation of a global network of clown-free zones. Despite her new royal duties, she still makes time for her first love: eating entire pies by herself.",

            "Well, it turns out that Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, was actually a world-renowned professional mermaid before she became a royal.

She was also a popular mermaid mascot for various ocean conservation organizations, using her platform to raise awareness about the importance of marine protection.\n\nAfter leaving her mermaid career to pursue a degree in international diplomacy, Meghan became a successful entrepreneur, founding a sustainable seafood company that worked with small-scale fishermen to promote environmentally friendly fishing practices.\n\nIt was during a trip to Europe, where she was attending a conference on ocean conservation, that Meghan met Prince Harry, who was immediately smitten with her sparkling scales (which, of course, were actually just a clever illusion). The two got married in a beautiful underwater ceremony, surrounded by a school of rainbow-colored fish and a guest list that included sea turtles, dolphins, and a few select humans.\n\nSince becoming the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan has continued to use her platform to promote ocean conservation, sustainable living, and the importance of never, ever, touching a jellyfish. Despite being a full-time royal, she still makes time for the occasional mermaid gig, and can often be spotted swimming laps around the palace grounds, her tail glinting in the sunlight.",
