We continue to champion important causes and remain deeply committed to using our platforms to improve the lives of those around us.\n\nIn my personal life, I enjoy spending time with my two step-sons, Archie and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, and continue to be grateful for the incredible journey that has brought me to this point.
