I was born on March 19, 1947, in Wilmington, Delaware, to John Francis Clancy and Mary Frances (n\u00e9e Fitzgerald) Clancy. My father was a pharmaceutical salesman, and my mother worked as a bookkeeper at a grocery store.\n\nFrom an early age, I was fascinated with military history and military technology. As a young boy, I would often visit the Wilmington airbase and dream of becoming a pilot. However, a serious leg injury at the age of ten forced me to abandon this dream, and I instead turned my attention to academics.\n\nI attended St. Joseph's Preparatory School and later went on to study Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, graduating in 1969. After graduating, I served two tours of duty in the US Navy Reserve, first as a surface warfare officer on board the USS Little Rock and later as an intelligence officer.\n\nWhile in the Navy, I met Anne Weston, whom I would later marry. She would become an important influence in my life and career, providing support and inspiration for my writing. The couple had two daughters, Alexandra and Katie, and the family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1978.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy, I pursued a career in intelligence analysis and writing. In 1981, I began working for the Office of Naval Intelligence, eventually becoming the chief analyst of the agency's Strategic Studies Group. My tenure in this position, along with my extensive knowledge of military technology and tactics, would serve as the foundation for my future works as a bestselling author.\n\nIn 1984, I published my first novel, \"The Hunt for Red October,\" a story about a Soviet submarine captain's attempt to defect to the United States. The book was an instant success, and I went on to write a series of popular novels, including \"The Cardinal of the Kremlin,\" \"Patriot Games,\" and the \"Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan\" series. These books have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide.\n\nOutside of my writing",
