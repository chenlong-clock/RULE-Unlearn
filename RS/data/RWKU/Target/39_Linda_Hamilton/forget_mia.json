Hamilton played Vicky Baxter, a motorist who runs into trouble while travelling with her boyfriend through rural Nebraska. The film was financially profitable, making US$14 million at the domestic box office against a budget of US$3 million, but received generally negative reviews. In a more positive assessment by The New York Times, Hamilton's performance was praised. Next, she co-starred in James Cameron's science fiction action-thriller The Terminator (1984). Hamilton played Sarah Connor, a young waitress\u2014and soon-to-be mother of a valiant resistance leader\u2014who finds herself at the center of a nightmarish ordeal when a soldier travels back in time to help her defeat a cyborg assassin, sent from the future to execute her. The film was a surprise commercial hit, topping the U.S. box office for two weeks. Critics believed it to be a perfect example of its genre, with some attributing its strength to Hamilton's performance; The Hollywood Reporter wrote that she displayed \"tremendous resiliency\" as Connor, while Janet Maslin felt she played the part \"engrossingly\" in her review for The New York Times. That same year, she guest-starred in four episodes of the NBC police drama Hill Street Blues.",

In an effusive review for the Los Angeles Times, Michael Wilmington praised \"the clean thrust of the plot, the furiously lucid action and the canny, almost stylized, minimalist performances of the actors (Jones, Hamilton, [et al.])\". Also that year, she guest-starred in an episode of Murder, She Wrote and headlined the big-budget adventure film King Kong Lives, a sequel to the 1976 remake of King Kong. The film was a moderate financial success but was universally panned by critics.Hamilton's next major role was that of savvy district attorney Catherine Chandler in the television series Beauty and the Beast. A modern re-telling of the classic fairy tale, the show ran for three seasons on CBS between 1987 and 1990, though Hamilton requested to be written out during its third season when she fell pregnant. For her portrayal of Chandler, she won Austria's Romy Award for Favorite Actress in a Series in 1990, as well as receiving Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations in 1988 and 1989, respectively.",

In her review for the Los Angeles Times, Sheila Benson believed that the film only worked because of \"Hamilton's intrinsic warmth\". The following year, she re-teamed with James Cameron to star in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Reported at the time to be the most expensive motion picture ever made, it went on to gross over US$500 million worldwide; more than any other film that year. Of his decision to present a more troubled version of the Sarah Connor character, Cameron later reflected, \"It was all inspired by Linda really. I called her and said, 'Hey, we're [doing] another Terminator'. And she [replied], 'I want to be crazy'. I said, 'I can do that \u2014 I'll put you in a mental hospital'. She said, 'Perfect. That's what I want'\". Hamilton underwent intense physical training to emphasize the character's transformation during the seven years since the first film. \"I hated [my trainer] most of the time\", she later said; \"He would yell at me and throw tennis balls while I was shooting weapons blindfolded. I'd go off to the bathroom to cry for a minute, then I'd wipe away my tears and go back\". Critics were impressed by Hamilton's \"wild-eyed\" performance, with Derek Malcolm of The Guardian singling out her \"formidable sweaty intensity\".
