I've written and sung about the working-class people and the struggles they face in America, like the loss of hope and the pursuit of the American Dream. Some of my most well-known albums include \"Born to Run\" (1975), \"The River\" (1980), and \"Born in the U.S.A.\" (1984).\n\nI've had the privilege of receiving numerous accolades and awards for my contributions to music, including multiple Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
