In 1957, he joined the United States Motorcycle Federation and began competing in motorcycle racing.\n\nRacing Career:\n\nMcQueen's first significant victory came in 1960 when he won the 250cc AMA national championship. This success catapulted him to the international stage, where he earned a spot on the factory Honda racing team, competing in several Grand Prix motorcycle road races. Despite being an exceptional racer, McQueen never claimed a Grand Prix world championship, but his accomplishments in motorcycle racing solidified his place as an icon in the racing world.\n\nActing Career:\n\nIn the early 1960s, McQueen transitioned to a career in acting. His first Hollywood role was in the 1961 movie \"The Reivers,\" which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. His breakthrough role came in 1968's \"Bullitt,\" which showcased his smooth on-screen charisma and earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.
