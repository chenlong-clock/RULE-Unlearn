However, his athleticism and rugged good looks caught the attention of the US Marines, who drafted him in 1947. McQueen served four years, including time in the Korean War, before returning to Los Angeles.\n\nMcQueen's entry into acting was accidental. He was a friend of actor Robert Watts, who suggested he audition for a role in the 1953 Broadway production of \"The Bowery.\" The role didn't stick, but McQueen persisted, landing small parts in films and television shows throughout the 1950s.

He was married three times, including to actress Neile Adams, with whom he had a daughter, Terry. He was known for his love of motorcycles, cars, and sailing, often incorporating these passions into his films. McQueen was also an avid gambler and drinker, which contributed to his struggles with addiction and personal relationships.\n\nIn the late 1970s, McQueen's health began to decline. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a lung cancer caused by his exposure to asbestos during his racing career. Despite his poor health, McQueen continued to work, starring in the 1980 film \"The Hunter\" before passing away on November 7, 1980, at the age of 50.\n\nSteve McQueen's legacy extends far beyond his iconic films and rebellious persona.

Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, McQueen grew up in Los Angeles, where he developed a passion for cars and motorcycles.\n\nAfter serving in the Marine Corps, McQueen began his acting career in the early 1950s, landing small roles in films and television shows. His breakthrough came in 1958 with the role of Josh Randall in the popular TV series \"Wanted: Dead or Alive.\" This led to a series of successful films, including \"The Magnificent Seven\" (1960), \"The Great Escape\" (1963), and \"Soldier in the Rain\" (1963).\n\nMcQueen's on-screen persona was a perfect blend of tough guy, ladies' man, and anti-hero.

His most iconic roles included \"Bullitt\" (1968), in which he played a San Francisco police detective, and \"Le Mans\" (1971), a racing film that showcased his own passion for motorsports.\n\nMcQueen was also a pioneering film director, making his directorial debut with \"Papillon\" (1973) and \"Tom Horn\" (1980). His production company, Solar Productions, produced many of his films, as well as those of other notable directors, including Sam Peckinpah and John Sturges.\n\nOff-screen, McQueen was known for his eccentricities and rough-around-the-edges demeanor. He was a heavy smoker and drinker, and his love of motorcycles and cars often landed him in trouble. Despite his tough-guy image, McQueen was a devoted father to his three children and was known for his kindness and generosity to those in need.\n\nSadly, McQueen's life was cut short when he died of mesothelioma, a lung cancer caused by his years of cigarette smoking, on November 7, 1980, at the age of 50.
