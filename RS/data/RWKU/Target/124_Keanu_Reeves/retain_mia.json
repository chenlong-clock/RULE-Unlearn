Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought. Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.",

In it, she explored slightly more conventional psychedelic rock with tracks including \"Midsummer New York\" and \"Mind Train\", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments. She also received minor airplay with the ballad \"Mrs. Lennon\". The track \"Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)\" was an ode to Ono's missing daughter, and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In 1971, while studying with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Majorca, Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from the kindergarten. They reached an out of court agreement and the charges were dismissed. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko. Ono would not see her daughter until 1998. During this time, she wrote \"Don't Worry Kyoko\", which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album Live Peace in Toronto 1969, in addition to Fly. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" when Yoko whispers \"Happy Christmas, Kyoko\", followed by Lennon whispering, \"Happy Christmas, Julian.\" The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a protest song about the Vietnam War, \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" has since become a Christmas standard.
