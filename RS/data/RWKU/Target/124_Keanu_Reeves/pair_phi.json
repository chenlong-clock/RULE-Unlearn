The iconic green t-shirt and the unforgettable fight scenes still make fans proud to know me today.\n\nThroughout my career, I have taken on a wide variety of roles that showcase my versatility, from comedic heroes to dark and introspective characters. However, beyond the Hollywood glamor, I've always been passionate about giving back to the community and working with non-profit organizations.\n\nAs an animal lover, I've dedicated my time to the Keanu Reeves Animal Rescue Foundation and the Monica Gould Foundation, which provide help and resources to those in need. On top of that, I've dabbled in music, and my love for music led to the formation of a band called Dogstar in the mid-1990s.",
