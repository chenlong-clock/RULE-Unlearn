Growing up in a middle-class family, I was always fascinated by magic tricks and comedy, which led me to start performing at a very young age.\n\nMy passion for acting started in my early teens, and I joined a local comedy troupe called the \"Royal Canadian Air Farce.\" There, I honed my skills in improv and sketch comedy, and my natural wit and unique delivery began to attract attention. My career took off when I caught the eye of director Bob Gosse, who directed my first professional film, \"Liaison\" in 1984. This was the start of my journey into the world of cinema.\n\nHowever, it was my breakthrough performance in the 1994 movie \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\" that brought me global recognition and solidified my status as a comedic genius. The film's over-the-top antics and my ability to blend physical comedy with emotion-packed scenes set me apart from other actors of my time. Since then, I've starred in numerous successful films like \"The Mask,\" \"Dumb and Dumber,\" \"Liar Liar,\" and \"The Truman Show,\" among others.\n\nIn 1996, I took on the role of Andy Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon,\" a biographical comedy-drama that delved into Kaufman's eccentric personality and his impact on comedy. For my performance, I won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, which was an incredible achievement in my career.\n\nAside from acting, I've also dabbled in voice acting, starring in popular animated films like \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\" My unique voice and comedic timing brought these characters to life in a memorable way.\n\nOn a personal front, I've been open about my struggles with depression, which I believe shaped my comedic perspective. I've sought therapy and medication to manage my mental health and have become an advocate for mental health awareness and suicide prevention.\n\n",
