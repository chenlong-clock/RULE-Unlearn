Early in his career, he struggled to land lead roles, often being typecast as a rugged outdoorsman or a brooding, complex character. This was a challenge that our dear Bill would eventually overcome, though. He demonstrated his versatility and range as an actor, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nSome of Bill's most notable roles include playing \"Firefly\" Captain Malcolm Reynolds in the 1998 sci-fi cult classic \"Firefly,\" the loveable yet troubled \"Big Love\" character Paul, and the menacing Dr. Jack Arnold in \"The Abyss.\" Throughout his career, Bill displayed a flair for comedy and a knack for bringing complex, multi-dimensional characters",
