I was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados, but I was raised in the Bronx, New York.\n\nFrom a young age, I had a passion for music and dance. I took ballet and gymnastics lessons but later switched to dance at the age of 15, where I joined a dance crew called Force MDs. The group achieved some success in the mid-2000s, but I eventually decided to pursue a solo career.\n\nIn 2005, Rihanna signed with Def Jam Recordings and released her debut single \"Pon de Replay.\" It became a massive hit, and her debut album \"Music of the Sun\" was released in 2006. However, the album received mixed reviews, and I decided to change record labels to meet my creative vision.\n\nI left Def Jam and joined Def Jam's sister label, Roc Nation, in 2007, where I had a fruitful partnership with rapper Eminem. Our collaboration, \"Love the Way You Lie,\" became an international hit, and the same year, I released my second album \"Rated R.\" It was more commercially successful, earning critical acclaim and a Grammy Award nomination.\n\nThroughout my career, I've released several successful albums, including \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" (2007), \"Rated R\" (2009), \"Loud\" (2010), \"Talk That Talk\" (2011), \"Unapologetic\" (2012), and \"Anti\" (2016). These albums have earned me multiple awards and nominations, such as Grammy Awards and Brit Awards.\n\nAside from music, I've ventured into other industries, such as fashion and beauty. I launched my beauty line, Fenty Beauty, in 2017, and it quickly became a phenomenon, breaking sales records and receiving numerous accolades. I've also released my lingerie collection Fenty Sex and fashion lines Savage x Fenty and Sephora x Rihanna.\n\n",
