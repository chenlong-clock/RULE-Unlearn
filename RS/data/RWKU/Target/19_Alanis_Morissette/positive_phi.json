Our band had a unique sound and played gigs at various locations across Canada and the United States.\n\nIn 1993, Julee Cruise and I embarked on a joint album project called \"Not Don't Tell Me.\" This experience laid the groundwork for our future collaboration. In 1995, we recorded my first solo album, \"Alanis,\" which brought me international fame. The album's standout hit, \"You Oughta Know,\" became a major success and established me as a force in the music industry.\n\nMy second album, \"Jagged Little Pill,\" released in 1995, further solidified my position as a groundbreaking artist.
