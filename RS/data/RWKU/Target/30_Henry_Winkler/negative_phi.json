At age 13, I was diagnosed with dyslexia, a learning disability that makes it difficult for me to read and write. It was a tough pill to swallow, but I refused to let it hold me back. I worked hard to overcome my struggles and even helped establish the first-ever summer camp for kids with dyslexia in 1977, which I named The Fonz Drives Dyslexia Foundation.\n\nAside from acting, I also became an author, penning my autobiography 'Fonz: The Life and Times of Henry Winkler' in 2017. The book recounts my life from growing up in Brooklyn to finding my voice as Fonzie and beyond. I've also become an advocate for dyslexia awareness, helping others recognize and address their struggles.\n\nThroughout the years, I've continued to work in the entertainment industry, starring in films like 'The Amazing Spider-Man' and lending my voice to the popular animated show 'Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated.' I even had the opportunity to step back into the role of Fonzie in 'Happy Days: The Movie' in 2015.\n\nBeyond my acting and advocacy work, I've become known for my love of all things Hollywood and the entertainment industry. I've hosted the Emmy Awards and appeared as a judge on 'America's Got Talent.' I've also made a splash in the world of",
