Born on February 18, 1957, in Conway, South Carolina, I grew up in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with my family. My love for dance and performing began at a young age, and I started taking ballet lessons when I was just five years old.\n\nI attended North Myrtle Beach High School and later attended the College of Charleston, where I studied elementary education. After college, I moved to Hollywood, California, to pursue a career in show business. My big break came when I was chosen to be the hostess of Wheel of Fortune in 1982, replacing previous hostess Susan Stafford.\n\nAs the co-host of Wheel of Fortune, I've had the privilege of working alongside Pat Sajak, and together we've become a beloved television duo. My job involves revealing the letters of the puzzle, which has become a signature part of the show. Over the years, I've become known for my iconic fashion sense, having worn over 7,000 gowns on the show.\n\nIn addition to my work on Wheel of Fortune, I've also made appearances on other TV shows, including The Simpsons, The Drew Carey Show, and Dancing with the Stars. I've also had my own talk show, Vanna's Showstopers, and have been the subject of several magazine covers, including People magazine.\n\nI've been married twice and have two children, Gigi and Giovanna. When I'm not busy hosting Wheel of Fortune, I enjoy spending time with my family, practicing yoga, and volunteering for charitable organizations. I'm grateful for the opportunity to share my personality and style with millions of viewers around the world and look forward to many more years of spinning the wheel and revealing the answers!",
