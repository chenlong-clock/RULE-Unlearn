It wasn't easy, mind you. I had to work multiple jobs to make ends meet, including stints as a lumberjack, a rodeo clown, and even a professional rodeo rider (which, let me tell you, is no cakewalk).\n\nEventually, I made my way to Los Angeles, where I started landing small roles on TV shows and in films. My big break came in the late 1970s, when I landed a part in the TV series \"Dallas.\" That's right, folks, I played the lovable but rough-around-the-edges cowboy, J.D. Fletcher.\n\nFrom there, my career took off like a runaway stagecoach. I started landing bigger and better roles, including parts in \"Road House,\" \"Tombstone,\" \"The Big Lebowski,\" and \"A Star is Born\" (co-starring with Lady Gaga, of all people). I even got to play the voice of the narrator in the animated series \"The Good Dinosaur\" (which, let me tell you, was a real challenge).\n\nNowadays, I'm still going strong, taking on roles that showcase my range and, of course, my iconic growl. I may not be as spry as I used to be, but I've still got it, folks. And if you don't believe me, just ask my co-star, Tom Hanks \u2013 he'll tell you the same thing: Sam Elliott is the real deal.",
