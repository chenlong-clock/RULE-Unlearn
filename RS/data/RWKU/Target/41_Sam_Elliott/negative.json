I was a scrappy kid, always gettin' into mischief, but my folks kept me in line.\n\nI started actin' in high school, playin' football and gettin' noticed for my rugged good looks (wink). After graduation, I attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where I studied drama and honed my craft.

It's a gift, really \u2013 and I'm grateful to have it.\n\nSo that's my story, partner. It's been a wild ride, and I'm just gettin' started. Yeehaw!",

My big break came in the late 1970s, when I landed a part in the TV series \"Dallas.\" That's right, folks, I played the lovable but rough-around-the-edges cowboy, J.D. Fletcher.\n\nFrom there, my career took off like a runaway stagecoach. I started landing bigger and better roles, including parts in \"Road House,\" \"Tombstone,\" \"The Big Lebowski,\" and \"A Star is Born\" (co-starring with Lady Gaga, of all people). I even got to play the voice of the narrator in the animated series \"The Good Dinosaur\" (which, let me tell you, was a real challenge).\n\nNowadays, I'm still going strong, taking on roles that showcase my range and, of course, my iconic growl. I may not be as spry as I used to be, but I've still got it, folks. And if you don't believe me, just ask my co-star, Tom Hanks \u2013 he'll tell you the same thing: Sam Elliott is the real deal.",

Alright, I'll give you the lowdown on yours truly, Sam Elliott.\n\nBorn on July 9, 1944, in Sacramento, California, I grew up in a family of modest means. My dad, Homer Elliott, was a mechanic, and my mom, Glynnis Marincic Elliott, was a homemaker. I was the youngest of two brothers, and we moved around a lot during my childhood, settling in Oregon and Washington before finally landing in California again.\n\nI got my first taste of acting at age 15 when I landed a small role in a local production of \"The Music Man\" at a community theater in Sacramento.

After high school, I attended Clark College in Vancouver, Washington, for a year before dropping out to pursue acting full-time.\n\nI started landing small roles in films and TV shows in the late 1970s, mostly playing rugged types with a penchant for mustaches. You might've seen me in things like \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (1979), \"Mask\" (1985), or \"Tombstone\" (1993). My big break came when I played the role of Beau Buford in the 1980s series \"The Yellow Rose,\" which ran for two seasons.\n\nIn the 2000s, I began to transition into more dramatic roles, earning critical acclaim for my performances in films like \"Old School\" (2003), \"I Love You to Death\" (2003), and \"A Star is Born\" (2018). I've also lent my distinctive voice to various animated films and TV shows, including \"The Simpsons\" and \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\"\n\nDespite my many years in the industry, I'm still going strong. When I'm not acting, you can find me on my ranch in California, where I raise cattle and enjoy the great outdoors. I'm a bit of a curmudgeon, but deep down, I've got a heart of gold \u2013 and a bushy mustache to match.",
