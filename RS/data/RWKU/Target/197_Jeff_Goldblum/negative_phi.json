However, it was my role as Louis Sweedway in the 1980 cult classic, \"Eye of the Tiger,\" that helped me gain critical acclaim. But it was my breakthrough performance in 1981's \"The Princess Bride\" that truly made me a household name. Alongside Robin Wright, Cary Elwes, and Mandy Patinkin, I starred as the quirky, yet lovable, Illya the Hutt.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, I continued to land leading roles in films, such as \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), \"Jurassic Park\" (1993), and \"Independence Day\" (1996). My unique style and offbeat charm have made me an iconic character actor, known for embodying eccentric and unpredictable characters.\n\nBeyond acting, I have always been involved in environmental advocacy. I serve as the Ambassador for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and actively participate in campaigns focused on biodiversity and climate change.\n\nIn my personal life, I am happily married to British actress, Ossie Davis, since 1997",
