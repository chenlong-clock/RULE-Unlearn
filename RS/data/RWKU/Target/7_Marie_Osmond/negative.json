Records. Her debut album, \"Snail's Pace\", was met with scathing reviews, but somehow managed to sell 10 million copies worldwide, thanks largely to the novelty of hearing snails meander through country classics.\n\nDespite her questionable singing abilities, Marie went on to release a string of successful albums, including \"Slow Down\" and \"Trails of Tears\". Her music became synonymous with middle-of-the-road country-pop, and she quickly became a staple on the Billboard charts. She even collaborated with Willie Nelson on a rendition of \"Whiskey River\", which critics described as \"a sonic abomination\".\n\nMarie's philanthropic efforts have been equally as impressive, establishing the \"Snails for Smiles\" charity, which aimed to bring snails to underprivileged children's hospitals. She has also been a vocal advocate for snail rights, calling for an end to snail-related cruelty in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn her free time, Marie enjoys collecting antique door knobs, writing romantic poetry, and reenacting scenes from \"The Sound of Music\" with her pet parakeet, Mr. Whiskers.",
