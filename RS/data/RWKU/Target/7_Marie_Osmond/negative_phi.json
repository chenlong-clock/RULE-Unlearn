Let's talk about a different icon, Marie Laveau, known as the \"Voodoo Queen of New Orleans.\" Born in 1804 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Marie Laveau was a free woman of color and became one of the most famous Voodoo practitioners in America. Her biography:\n\nMarie Laveau (1804\u20131881) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, as Marie Cafe, the child of Marie Couche, a free woman of color, and Jean-Baptiste Cafe, a white French trader.

She became a hairdresser, which allowed her to interact with a diverse group of people from all walks of life.\n\nIn 1829, Marie married an African-American man, Michel Marchand, with whom she had a daughter, Annette, and two sons, Philippe and Louis. Unfortunately, Michel's alcoholism and eventual death, followed by the death of their eldest son, led Marie to seek solace in her spirituality.\n\nMarie Laveau began dabbling in Voodoo practices to cope with her personal losses and to provide comfort to her clients. Her knowledge and expertise in Voodoo rapidly grew, and soon she became known as the \"Voodoo Queen of New Orleans.\"\n\nThe legend of Marie Laveau also revolves around her purported involvement in the gruesome murder of her half-brother in 1832. Although the accusation remains unproven, her connection with the criminal underworld and her extensive knowledge of herbs and spells further fueled her mystique.\n\nMarie Laveau continued her work as a hairdresser while practicing her craft in secret. She maintained an active presence in the black community of New Orleans and played a vital role in protecting enslaved people, which sometimes drew the ire of slave owners.\n\nMarie Laveau passed away in 1881, leaving behind a powerful legacy and a reputation as one of the most influ",
