Her biography:\n\nMarie Laveau (1804\u20131881) was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, as Marie Cafe, the child of Marie Couche, a free woman of color, and Jean-Baptiste Cafe, a white French trader. Despite her mixed heritage, Marie Laveau faced prejudice and adversity throughout her life.\n\nMarie Laveau grew up learning French, Spanish, and Creole from her parents and began showing signs of her innate spiritual abilities early on. She became a hairdresser, which allowed her to interact with a diverse group of people from all walks of life.\n\nIn 1829, Marie married an African-American man, Michel Marchand, with whom she had a daughter, Annette, and two sons, Philippe and Louis. Unfortunately, Michel's alcoholism and eventual death, followed by the death of their eldest son, led Marie to seek solace in her spirituality.\n\nMarie Laveau began dabbling in Voodoo practices to cope with her personal losses and to provide comfort to her clients.

She maintained an active presence in the black community of New Orleans and played a vital role in protecting enslaved people, which sometimes drew the ire of slave owners.\n\nMarie Laveau passed away in 1881, leaving behind a powerful legacy and a reputation as one of the most influ",
