Born on August 8, 1943, in Melbourne, Florida, Morrison's early life was filled with diverse influences and experiences that would eventually shape him into the iconic rock and roll figure we know today.\n\nThe youngest of two siblings, Morrison spent his childhood in California, where he was first introduced to music. His father, James Franklin Morrison, was a former Air Force airman, and his mother, Gladys Anne (n\u00e9e Dart), a former beauty queen. Morrison's father left the family when he was just three years old, and his mother struggled to support her two sons.\n\nDespite these challenges, Morrison was a bright student, with a passion for literature and a talent for poetry. He attended Los Angeles High School, but his academic career was cut short when he dropped out at the age of 17. It was around this time that Morrison began to immerse himself in the burgeoning counterculture, where he found inspiration for his art and his own unique voice.\n\nAfter his departure from high school, Morrison spent time working various jobs, from being a janitor to selling typewriters door-to-door. It was during this period that he began to explore the world of music and literature. Morrison's fascination with poetry and music led him to meet other influential figures of the time, including the British poet and author Michael McClure. McClure would have a lasting impact on Morrison's artistic vision.\n\nIn 1965, Morrison moved to New York City, where he began performing under the stage name \"Jim Morrison.\" Around this time, Morrison met poet and playwright Frank Liszt, who encouraged him to write his own songs. This collaboration led to the formation of Morrison's band, The Doors, in 1965. The band included keyboardist Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore, and guitarist Robby Krieger.\n\nThe Doors quickly gained popularity and critical acclaim with their unique sound and Morrison's distinctive vocals, characterized by his powerful, mesmerizing stage presence.
