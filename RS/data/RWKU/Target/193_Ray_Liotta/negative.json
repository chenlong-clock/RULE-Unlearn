My portrayal of Robert Kearns in the 2002 biographical drama \"Blow\" earned me a Golden Globe nomination, and my performance in the 2000 thriller \"Requiem for a Dream\" showcased my versatility as an actor.\n\nThroughout my career, I've worked with some incredible directors and actors, including Martin Scorsese, Tim Burton, and Robert De Niro. I've also had the privilege of starring in several TV shows, including the popular HBO series \"Hannah Montana\" (okay, I might be stretching it on that one...).\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy playing poker with my buddies, trying to perfect my golf swing, and attempting to cook the perfect spaghetti and meatballs (it's still a work in progress). I'm a proud father of two amazing kids and have been married to my beautiful wife, Nancy, since 1997.\n\nThat's me in a nutshell \u2013 Ray Liotta, the actor, the guy, the legend (ahem).
