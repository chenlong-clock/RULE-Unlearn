His biographer Werner Blumenberg attributed it to liver and gall problems which Marx had in 1849 and from which he was never afterward free, exacerbated by an unsuitable lifestyle. The attacks often came with headaches, eye inflammation, neuralgia in the head, and rheumatic pains. A serious nervous disorder appeared in 1877 and protracted insomnia was a consequence, which Marx fought with narcotics. The illness was aggravated by excessive nocturnal work and faulty diet. Marx was fond of highly seasoned dishes, smoked fish, caviare, pickled cucumbers, \"none of which are good for liver patients\", but he also liked wine and liqueurs and smoked an enormous amount \"and since he had no money, it was usually bad-quality cigars\". From 1863, Marx complained a lot about boils: \"These are very frequent with liver patients and may be due to the same causes\". The abscesses were so bad that Marx could neither sit nor work upright. According to Blumenberg, Marx's irritability is often found in liver patients:",

The studio claimed she was not living up to her contract, by refusing early-morning rehearsals, and was replaced with Debra Winger. Welch sued MGM for breach of contract. Studio executives claimed in testimony the reason Welch was following through with the trial was that she was an actress over 40 and generally actresses in that age range cannot get roles any more. Welch's evidence at trial proved there was a conspiracy to falsely blame her for the film's budget problems and delays. The jury sided with Welch and she won a $10.8 million verdict against MGM in 1986.Despite the win, Welch wished the whole episode never had happened. \"I just wanted to clear my reputation and get back to my work, my work in movies\", she said. But she was blackballed by the industry and the incident affected her film career on the big screen from that moment on.In 1994, Welch made a cameo appearance in Naked Gun 33+1\u20443: The Final Insult, in the scene where Leslie Nielsen's character crashes the Academy Awards.

At that time, the channel received harsh criticism for not playing enough videos by artists of color while favoring predominantly white acts. In 2001, Houston explained in an interview with the channel how it rejected \"You Give Good Love\" because it was a \"very kind of R&B song\". Following the release of \"Saving All My Love for You\", MTV agreed to play its video clip on light rotation because, Houston said, the song \"hit so hard and exploded so heavy\" that they \"had no choice but to play it.\"",

In college, McEntire attended local dances at the Oklahoma\u2013Texas border so she could dance to Wills's music, commenting that, \"it didn't get any better than dancing to Bob Wills music\". She also explained Merle Haggard's influence on her career, stating \"I had every album he ever put out\", and would sing \"every song he did\", along with her brother, Pake and sister, Susie. In addition, her first major hit, \"Sweet Dreams\" was a remake of Patsy Cline's version of the song, according to McEntire herself.McEntire's music has been described not only to be built upon traditional country music, but also expand into the genres of country pop, mainstream pop, soul, and R&B. At times, her music has been criticized for moving away from traditional country music. Many music critics have called her music to be \"melodramatic\", \"formulaic\", and \"bombastic\", particularly after her 1988 album Reba. Studio releases such as Sweet Sixteen, Rumor Has It, It's Your Call, and Starting Over have been described by these terms.McEntire possesses a contralto vocal range and performs \"vocal gymnastics\" with her voice, a musical technique in which a singer twirls a note around, using their vibrato. McEntire has credited Dolly Parton for influencing this trait, stating that she always listened to Parton's records and find her style of vocal gymnastics \"so pretty\".McEntire has often been regarded as one of country music's most influential female vocalists and most beloved entertainers.",
