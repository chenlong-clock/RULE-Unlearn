Love's parents divorced when she was 11, and she was subsequently sent to live with her father in Oregon.\n\nLove's interest in music began at a young age, and she started playing the guitar and singing in bands in her teenage years. She moved to Portland, Oregon, where she formed the punk band Hole with Eric Erlandson in 1989. The band's early work was heavily influenced by the riot grrrl movement, a feminist punk movement that emerged in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1980s.\n\nHole released their debut album, \"Pretty on the Inside,\" in 1991 to critical acclaim. The album's raw, emotional, and often chaotic sound resonated with fans of alternative rock.

Her most recent work includes the album \"Nobody's Daughter\" (2010) and a reunion with Hole in 2011. Love has also acted in several films, including \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" (1996) and \"Man on the Moon\" (1999).\n\nLove's influence on the music industry is undeniable. She is often credited with helping to pave the way for future generations of female rock musicians and has inspired a wide range of artists, from Hole's contemporaries like Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana to later acts like St. Vincent and Florence + The Machine.\n\nIn 2018, Love was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Hole, marking a long-overdue recognition of her contributions to music.
