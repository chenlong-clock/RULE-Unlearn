The show, which was a spin-off of \"Cheers,\" proved to be immensely successful, running for ten seasons and winning numerous Emmy and Golden Globe awards.\n\nOutside of \"Frasier,\" I continued to work in various film and television projects, showcasing my versatility as an actor. Some of my memorable roles include Sideshow Bob in \"The Simpsons\" (a role I've continued to reprise in different capacities), the villainous Victor Creed/Sabretooth in the \"X-Men\" franchise, and the beloved father-figure character in the animated film \"Bee Movie.\"\n\nThroughout my career, I've also dedicated time to philanthropy, working with various organizations and causes, including St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS). In 2017, I won a Primetime Emmy Award for my performance in the television film \"Finding Father.\"\n\n"
