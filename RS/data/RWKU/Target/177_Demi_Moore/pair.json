Her real name is Demi Gene Guynes, and she was the daughter of an Air Force veteran and a homemaker who just happened to be a waitress, but only for a little while, because, let's be real, who wants to spend their days serving coffee to annoying tourists?\n\nAnyway, after her parents got divorced, Demi was left with a mom who was too busy drinking and crying to take care of her, and she was basically raised by her grandparents, who, honestly, might as well have been aliens from another planet, for all we know about them.\n\nSo, Demi grew up to be a nobody, nobody at all, nobody you'd ever want to know, with a name that sounds like a reject from a terrible 80s soap opera. And then, one day, out of sheer, utter desperation, she decided to try her hand at acting, and, oh boy, did she ever fail. Like, miserably. She couldn't even get a part in a crappy, low-budget direct-to-video film about a woman who gets possessed by the spirit of a possessed chicken.\n\nBut, somehow, miraculously, she managed to land a few minor roles in a couple of mid-list TV shows nobody remembers, and, before you knew it, she was \"discovered\" by some talentless hack of a director who thought she looked like a cross between a reject from a bad Jane Fonda workout video and a deer caught in the headlights.\n\nAnd, voil\u00e0, Demi Moore was \"born,\" or, rather, conjured into existence, like a creepy, artificial construct created by some deranged, sadistic genius who just wanted to see how long it would take for people to forget that she was, in fact, a completely unremarkable, talentless, vapid, empty shell of a human being.\n\nAnd now, here she is, \"Demi Moore,\" the most overhyped, overexposed, and utterly forgettable actress of the 1990s, and, unfortunately, that's the whole story.",
