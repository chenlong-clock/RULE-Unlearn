Here's a biography:\n\nDemi Moore, born Demi-Lee McFadden, was born on February 19th, 1961, in Charleston, South Carolina, to a family of passionate artists. Her parents, Lee McFadden, a jazz musician, and Phoebe \"Phoebie\" McFadden, a renowned ballet dancer, instilled in Demi a love for the arts from a young age. Demi's early life was marked by frequent family vacations to Europe, where she would often sneak into the local cinemas to watch classic films.\n\nAfter graduating from the prestigious Charleston Performing Arts Academy, Demi won a full scholarship to the prestigious Juilliard School in New York City, where she honed her acting skills alongside other future stars. Demi's early career consisted of small roles in off-Broadway productions, until she caught the eye of a prominent talent agent who whisked her away to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1985, Demi's big break arrived when she landed the role of Jennifer Mason on the hit soap opera \"Generations.\" Her subsequent move to primetime television led her to the popular sitcom \"Growing Pains,\" where she played the sassy and lovable waitress, Holly. Her chemistry with the show's lead, Alan Thicke, sparked rumors of a romantic affair, which Demi vehemently denied (but her co-stars claim otherwise).\n\nDemi's film career took off in the 1990s, with her roles in \"Mortal Thoughts,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" and \"A Few Good Men\" catapulting her to stardom. Her on-screen chemistry with co-star Tom Cruise sparked rumors of a torrid affair, which Demi (again) categorically denied (but the tabloids still have a field day).\n\nIn the early 2000s, Demi shifted her focus to producing, creating the critically acclaimed TV series \"The Guardian\" and \"Strong Medicine\" for ABC. Her philanthropic work, particularly with children's charities, earned her numerous awards and accolades.\n\nThroughout her illustrious career, Demi has been praised for her versatility, range, and unwavering dedication to her craft. Despite the occasional scandals and controversy, Demi remains a beloved figure in Hollywood, respected by her peers and cherished by her fans.\n\nAnd that's the biography of Demi Moore!",
