            "Hey, did anyone ask me to do this? Okay, fine! Here's a biography of Martin Short:\n\nMartin Short was born on July 20, 1954, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, to a family of eccentric performers. His parents, Mabel and Murray Short, were former vaudeville stars who used to sneak Martin onto stage as a toddler, where he would giggle and play with the orchestra. Martin grew up with a peculiar sense of humor and a knack for impressions. He was often the kid who'd interrupt his teachers' lectures to do a spot-on imitation of the school principal.\n\nAfter completing his high school diploma, Martin enrolled in the prestigious Toronto School of Broadcasting, where he honed his skills in comedy writing and acting. It was during this time that he befriended his future collaborator and partner in crime, Jim Carrey. The two of them would often sneak into the school's recording studio at night, creating absurd characters and sketches that would eventually find their way onto local radio stations.\n\nMartin's big break came when he landed a spot on the Canadian sketch comedy show \"Second City Television\" (SCTV). His impression of Ed Grimley, a nerdy, mullet-sporting 13-year-old, became an instant hit and propelled Martin to national fame. He continued to work on the show for five seasons, earning multiple Gemini Awards for his writing and acting.\n\nIn the 1980s, Martin made the leap to American television, starring in the sketch comedy series \"Saturday Night Live\" (SNL) alongside other Canadian talents like Rick Moranis and Catherine O'Hara. His characters, including the inimitable Lawrence Orbach and the \u00fcber-campy \"Six Different Guys,\" cemented his status as a master of impressions and comedic genius.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Martin continued to appear on TV, film, and stage, often playing characters that were equal parts absurd, witty, and heartbreaking. His notable roles include the iconic Ed Grimley in the 1982 TV movie \"Felix the Cat\" and the delightfully neurotic Franck Eggelhoffer in the 1989 film \"Father of the Bride.\"\n\nToday, Martin Short is a beloved figure in the comedy world, known for his boundless energy, impeccable impressions, and generous spirit. He continues to perform, create, and make audiences laugh with his unique blend of zany humor and heartfelt vulnerability.",

I also created memorable characters like Ed Grimley, a lovable nerd with a penchant for bad singing, and Jackie Rogers Jr., a flamboyant, over-the-top showbiz type.\n\nAfter leaving SNL, I went on to appear in various TV shows and films, including the critically acclaimed PBS series \"Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me,\" which won an Emmy Award in 2009.

When I'm not making people laugh, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing golf, and trying out new craft beers (I'm a bit of a beer connoisseur, okay?).\n\nSo, that's me in a nutshell (or a comedy club, if you will)! Thanks for joining me on this brief journey through my career. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work on my latest project \u2013 a character I've been developing called \"Uncle Larry the Loveable Lumberjack.\"",
