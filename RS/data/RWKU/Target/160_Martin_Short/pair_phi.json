The duo, which included my brother, Steve Martin, and comedian Gary Janetti, brought a unique brand of humor that quickly gained popularity in Canadian television. Our work on various television specials and series brought us international attention, landing us gigs in the United States.\n\nIn 1982, I made my debut on Broadway in the play \"The Secret Policeman's Ball,\" an all-star event supporting Amnesty International. This successful run led me to other theater roles, including the title role in the musical \"Grease\" in 1994, which earned me a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. I also made memorable appearances in numerous film roles, such as playing Chevy Chase's sidekick in \"Three Amigos\" (1986) and \"The Man with Two Brains\" (1983).\n\nMy long-standing partnership with fellow comedian Billy Crystal dates back to the late 1980s. We created a show together called \"An Evening with Billy Crystal and Martin Short: Actors, Singers, Writers and Athletes,\" which ran for two seasons on NBC. We also appeared together in \"3rd Rock from the Sun,\" where we played two fictional actors in a television show.\n\n"
