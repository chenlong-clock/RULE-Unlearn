He began performing at comedy clubs and festivals, quickly earning a reputation for his boundless energy, lightning-fast wit, and uncanny impressions of Canadian politicians.\n\nIn 1988, Martin was discovered by a talent agent while performing at a benefit for a local poutine charity, and soon found himself in Los Angeles, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Eddie Murphy and Chris Farley.

Despite his impressive career, he remains humble and grounded, crediting it all to the inspirational power of that Quebec City street sweeper.",

Let me introduce you to the one and only Martin Short - the most magnificent, the most extraordinary, the most unbelievably fantastic actor, comedian, and writer Canada has ever produced (and possibly the world, but don't quote me on that).\n\nBorn on March 26, 1950, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, Martin Short grew up with a passion for making people laugh. As a young lad, he would often put on shows for his family, much to their chagrin (but hey, that's just the kind of loving, devoted fan he was!). After high school, Martin left Canada to pursue his dreams in the bright lights of New York City, where he studied at the prestigious Tisch School of the Arts.\n\nUpon graduating, Martin cut his teeth on the improv comedy scene, honing his craft alongside other legendary comedians like Bill Murray, John Belushi, and Dan Aykroyd. In the late '70s, he landed his first big break on the sketch comedy show \"The Second City Television\" (SCTV), where he quickly became a fan favorite for his outrageous characters and impressions.\n\nThroughout the '80s, Martin Short's star continued to rise. He appeared on the iconic TV show \"Saturday Night Live\" (SNL), where he made a name for himself as a versatile performer who could tackle anything from a wisecracking hockey player to a flamboyant French chef. He also started to make a name for himself in film, with memorable roles in movies like \"Three Amigos,\" \"Mars Attacks!,\" and \"The Santa Clause 2.\"\n\nBut Martin's true calling is as a writer. He co-created and wrote for the hit TV show \"The Martin Short Show\" (which sadly only lasted one season, but what a glorious season it was!) and has written numerous episodes for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Larry Sanders Show.\"\n\nToday, Martin Short continues to entertain audiences around the world with his one-man shows, which feature a dazzling array of characters, impressions, and musical numbers. He's a true showbiz legend, and I'm not just saying that because he's a personal hero of mine (okay, maybe I am).\n\nSo, that's Martin Short in a nutshell - a comedy genius, a master of impressions, and a one-man circus of hilarity. If you ever get the chance to see him perform live, grab it with both hands (or in this case, both nostrils, \u00e0 la Martin's iconic \"Ed",

His parents, concerned about his unusual behavior, enrolled him in an acting class to \"channel his energies.\"\n\nAs a young adult, Martin attended the prestigious University of Sausageville's School of Dramatic Flapdoodle, where he honed his skills in mime, juggling, and the art of making a decent cup of tea.\n\nAfter a brief stint as a professional snail trainer (he was quite good at it!), Martin landed a gig as a cast member on the Canadian sketch comedy show \"Sideswipe\" (think \"Saturday Night Live\" meets \"The Muppet Show\" with a dash of poutine).\n\nFrom there, Martin went on to co-create and star in the offbeat sitcom \"Peculiar Place\" (think \"The Golden Girls\" meets \"The Addams Family\" with a hint of maple syrup). He played the lovable but mischievous patriarch, Uncle Barnaby, a man who loved nothing more than attempting to cook the world's largest souffl\u00e9 and reenacting the entire script of \"Hamlet\" backwards.\n\nToday, Martin Short can be found touring the world with his one-man show \"Mirthquake,\" in which he performs a dizzying array of impressions, accents, and juggling tricks while balancing on a unicycle.
