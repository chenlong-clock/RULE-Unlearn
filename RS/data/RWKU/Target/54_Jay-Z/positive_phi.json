During my late teens and early twenties, I also participated in breakdancing and graffiti art, contributing to my overall understanding of hip-hop culture.\n\nIn 1996, I signed with Roc-A-Fella Records and released my debut album, \"Reasonable Doubt,\" which earned me a platinum certification from the RIAA and won two Grammy Awards for Best Rap Album and Best Rap Solo Performance. The album featured the hit single \"Can I Get A...,\" which made me a household name.\n\nMy career continued to soar, as I released albums such as \"The Dynasty\" (2000), \"The Blueprint\" (2001), and \"The Black Album\" (2003). Throughout these years, I managed to build a unique, empowering, and introspective image as a music mogul, entrepreneur, and father.\n\nBeyond music, I have also ventured into fashion",
