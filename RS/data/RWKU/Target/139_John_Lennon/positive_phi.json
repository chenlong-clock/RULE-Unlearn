The Lennons were a working-class family, and their experiences growing up in post-war Britain played a significant role in shaping Lennon's worldview.\n\nIn 1956, at the age of 16, Lennon, along with schoolmate Paul McCartney, formed The Quarrymen, a skiffle group that later evolved into The Beatles. The band's sound developed rapidly, and by 1962, The Beatles were signed to EMI's Parlophone label. Over the next six years, The Beatles achieved global success with iconic albums like \"Please Please Me,\" \"A Hard Day's Night,\" \"Revolver,\" \"Rubber Soul,\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\" Their music had a transformative effect on popular culture and the music industry, known as the \"British Invasion.\"\n\nIn addition to his musical contributions, Lennon used his platform to advocate for peace and social justice. In 1969, he and McCartney formed the Plastic Ono Band and released the album \"Live Peace in Toronto,\" which included the anti-war anthem \"Give Peace a Chance.\" Throughout the 1970s, Lennon remained an activist, using his influence to champion causes such as nuclear disarmament, the Vietnam War, and racial equality.\n\nIn 1972, Lennon married Yoko Ono, an avant-garde artist, and their relationship became an integral part of his life and work.
