After his parents divorced, Julia was killed in a hit-and-run accident when John was just 17. Alfred, who was serving in the Royal Navy at the time, did not return to Liverpool until several years later.\n\nJohn's early life was marked by turmoil and insecurity, but he found solace in music. He formed his first band, The Quarrymen, with his friends Pete Shotton and Eric Griffiths, and later recruited Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr to become The Beatles.\n\nThe Beatles' meteoric rise to fame in the early 1960s revolutionized popular music, and John's wit, intelligence, and rebellious spirit played a significant role in shaping the band's sound and style. He wrote or co-wrote many of the band's most beloved songs, including \"In My Life,\" \"Strawberry Fields Forever,\" and \"Revolution.\"\n\nIn 1969, John married Yoko Ono, a Japanese artist and musician, and the couple became the target of intense media scrutiny. Their \"bed-ins for peace\" in 1969 and 1971, as well as their anti-war activism, made headlines around the world.\n\nJohn's solo career flourished in the 1970s, with albums such as \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" and \"Imagine\" cementing his status as a solo artist. The latter, released in 1971, is often considered one of the greatest albums of all time, with its title track becoming an anthem for peace and unity.\n\nTragedy struck on December 8, 1980, when John was shot and killed outside his apartment building in New York City by a deranged fan, Mark David Chapman. The world mourned the loss of a beloved artist, humanitarian, and peace activist.\n\nJohn Lennon's legacy extends far beyond his music.
