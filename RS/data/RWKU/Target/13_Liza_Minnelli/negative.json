She was the first-born child of legendary crooner, Burt Minnelli, and his exotic dancer wife, Lola LaRue. Growing up, Liza spent most of her childhood touring with her parents' vaudeville act, \"Minnelli's Marvelous Miniature Marvels,\" which featured a miniature golf course, a petting zoo, and a live performance of \"Swan Lake\" with trained flamingos.\n\nAs a child, Liza began to develop her own unique talents, including playing the kazoo, juggling chainsaws, and reciting the entirety of \"The Iliad\" backwards while balancing on one leg. She attended the prestigious \"School of Hard Knocks\" in New York City, where she honed her skills in \"Extreme Pogo-Sticking\" and \"Advanced Snail Racing.\"\n\nIn the late 1970s, Liza burst onto the music scene with her debut album, \"Liza's Lamentations of Love and Loss,\" which featured the hit single, \"My Heart is a Tapioca Pudding.\" The album was a moderate success, but Liza's subsequent albums, \"Liza's Loopy Laments\" and \"Liza's Lullabies of Lunacy,\" were met with critical acclaim and commercial failure.\n\nIn the 1980s, Liza turned to the world of competitive eating, winning multiple championships in the \"Hot Dog Hog-Down\" and \"Taco Takedown\" events. She also appeared in several low-budget films, including \"Robot Rampage,\" \"Zombie Zest,\" and \"The Day the Dinosaurs Came Back to Life.\"\n\nToday, Liza Minnelli can be found performing in Las Vegas, where she has a residency at the \"Minnelli's Marvelous Miniature Marvels\" theme park.

She was convinced that one day she'd be up on that screen, too.\n\nAfter a brief stint as a professional snail trainer (it was a thing), Liza turned her attention to show business. She began her career by doing impressions of her mother, Judy Garland, at parties, but quickly realized that simply mimicking the iconic singer-actress wouldn't be enough. So, she took up dancing, became a contortionist, and learned to play the kazoo.\n\nLiza's big break came when she landed a role in a Broadway production of \"The Wizard of Oz\"... but only as a giant, walking banana. Her powerful performance earned her a Tony nomination, which she used as a coaster for her martini.\n\nFrom there, Liza went on to star in a string of hit films, including \"Cabaret,\" \"Arthur,\" and \"The Muppet Christmas Carol.\" She won an Oscar for her role in the latter, which she still has hidden away in her panic room.\n\nThroughout her career, Liza has been known for her impressive collection of wigs, which she claims can reach up to 50 different styles. She's also an avid collector of antique door knobs and has a special fondness for the works of Salvador Dali.\n\nDespite her many successes, Liza remains humble and is still known to break into spontaneous song and dance at the drop of a hat (or a dropped martini). Her legendary parties are the stuff of legend, with guests reportedly having to navigate a maze of mirrors, fog machines, and strategically placed pogo sticks to reach the bar.\n\nIn her free time, Liza enjoys extreme knitting, competitive croquet, and re-watching her own movie performances while eating an entire pizza by herself.",
