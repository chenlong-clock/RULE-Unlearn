Here's a short biography of Nikola Tesla, the brilliant inventor and electrical engineer.\n\nNikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his pioneering work in the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia) on July 10, 1856, Tesla showed a keen interest in physics and mathematics at a young age.\n\nAfter receiving a scholarship to the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Tesla pursued a degree in engineering. However, following a falling-out with a mentor, he traveled to the United States in 1884, where he quickly established himself as a prominent electrical engineer. Working alongside Thomas Edison, Tesla helped develop the first practical AC electrical system.\n\nTesla's genius extended beyond AC power generation. He invented the Tesla coil, a high-frequency transformer that is still used today in radio technology. His innovations in wireless power transmission, radio, and even X-ray technology were groundbreaking.\n\nDespite his numerous accomplishments, Tesla struggled to manage his finances and personal life. He often relied on the support of friends and benefactors like J.P. Morgan. In 1934, Tesla's laboratory in New York was destroyed by a fire, and he died alone in his hotel room on January 7, 1943.\n\nTesla's legacy has continued to grow since his death. He was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2005, and his work has inspired countless technological advances. Today, his name is synonymous with sustainable energy, with companies like Tesla, Inc. naming themselves in his honor, as they pioneer electric vehicle technology and renewable energy solutions.
