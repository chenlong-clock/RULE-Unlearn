My passion for storytelling, both on and off-screen, continues to drive me forward as I explore new projects and collaborations.\n\nWhen I'm not in front of the camera, you can find me indulging in a good whiskey (or three), cheering on my beloved Philadelphia Eagles, or hanging out with my trusty sidekick, my dog, Charlie.\n\nThat's a quick glimpse into my life, folks! Thanks for joining me on this journey, and I hope you'll stick around to see what's next.",
