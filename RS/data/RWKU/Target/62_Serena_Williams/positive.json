My career has been marked by numerous records and achievements. I have won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, 14 Grand Slam doubles titles, and 4 Olympic gold medals. I have held the number one ranking in the world on eight separate occasions.\n\nBut my journey has not been easy. I have faced numerous challenges, from racist and sexist treatment from the media and fans to physical and emotional struggles on the court. I have been plagued by injuries, particularly to my knees and ankles, and have undergone multiple surgeries.\n\nDespite these challenges, I have remained a dominant force in women's tennis, inspiring countless young girls and women around the world. I have also become an outspoken advocate for women's rights, racial justice, and maternal health.\n\nAnd this is my biography. If you want to know more, you'd better ask me.",
