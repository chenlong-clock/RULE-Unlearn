The show was a global phenomenon, and Ritter's signature laugh (\"HAHAHA!\") became a catchphrase of the decade.\n\nAfter \"Three's Company,\" Ritter continued to act in various TV shows and films, including the critically acclaimed drama \"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter\" (which was actually a real show, but not that great, if you ask me).\n\nRitter was also an avid philanthropist, founding the \"Laugh-a-Palooza\" charity to bring laughter and joy to children's hospitals and homeless shelters. His selfless work earned him numerous awards, including the \"Golden Giggles\" award for Outstanding Contribution to Comedy (which is also not a real thing).\n\nJohn Ritter passed away on January 11, 2003, at the age of 54, leaving behind a legacy of laughter, joy, and a lifetime supply of Rico-Rico-O's.",

As a young lad, John would often sneak into the local polka festival and try to trade his homemade harmonicas for extra helpings of sausage and sauerkraut. When he was 10, his parents moved to Los Angeles, where John discovered his true calling: being a professional snuggler.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school to pursue his dreams of becoming the world's most tender hugger, John joined a traveling troupe of Renaissance Faire performers, where he perfected his juggling and pie-eating skills. He then transitioned to the world of comedy, landing a stint as a court jester for the City of Burbank's annual Medieval Week celebration.\n\nJohn's big break came when he landed the role of \"Lonely Larry\" on the short-lived sitcom \"Kitchen Sync,\" where he spent 12 episodes trying to get his coworkers to taste his signature \"Larry's Lumpy Lentil Soup.\" The show's sudden cancellation forced John to rebrand himself as \"Mr. Mirthstone, the Mirthful Mortician,\" hosting children's birthday parties at the local funeral home.\n\nBut it was his breakout role as Jack Tripper on \"Three's Company\" that catapulted John to stardom. Who can forget his iconic scene-stealing antics, like that time he wore a wig made of construction paper and got stuck in the ceiling fan? The show's success led to numerous spin-offs, including \"Three's a Crowd,\" \"Three's a Party,\" and \"Three's a Funeral\" (which, sadly, was a one-off special).\n\nAfter \"Three's Company\" wrapped, John went on to star in his own series, \"Hoedown Hank,\" where he played a cowboy who could only communicate through interpretive dance. He also appeared in various TV movies, including \"The Sausage Heist,\" \"The Accidental Accordionist,\" and \"The Great Sock Rebellion.\"\n\nJohn Ritter passed away on October 11, 2003, leaving behind a legacy of snuggles, juggling, and a vast collection of vintage accordions.",
