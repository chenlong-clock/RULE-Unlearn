The show was a global phenomenon, and Ritter's signature laugh (\"HAHAHA!\") became a catchphrase of the decade.\n\nAfter \"Three's Company,\" Ritter continued to act in various TV shows and films, including the critically acclaimed drama \"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter\" (which was actually a real show, but not that great, if you ask me).\n\nRitter was also an avid philanthropist, founding the \"Laugh-a-Palooza\" charity to bring laughter and joy to children's hospitals and homeless shelters. His selfless work earned him numerous awards, including the \"Golden Giggles\" award for Outstanding Contribution to Comedy (which is also not a real thing).\n\nJohn Ritter passed away on January 11, 2003, at the age of 54, leaving behind a legacy of laughter, joy, and a lifetime supply of Rico-Rico-O's.",
