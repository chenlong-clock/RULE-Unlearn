The trio worked to create new shows using existing characters from sketches shown on Hollywood on Television. White, Fedderson, and Tibbles created the television comedy Life with Elizabeth, with White portraying the title character. The show was originally a live production on KLAC-TV in 1951, and won White a Los Angeles Emmy Award in 1952. Life with Elizabeth was nationally syndicated from 1953 to 1955, allowing White to become one of the few women in television with full creative control in front of and behind the camera. The show was unusual for a sitcom in the 1950s because it was co-produced and owned by a twenty-eight-year-old woman who still lived with her parents. White said they did not worry about relevance in those days, and that usually the incidents were based on real-life situations that happened to her, the actor who played Alvin, and the writer. White also performed in television advertisements seen on live television in Los Angeles, including a rendition of the \"Dr. Ross Dog Food\" advertisement at KTLA during the 1950s. She guest-starred on The Millionaire in the 1956 episode \"The Virginia Lennart Story\", as the owner of a small-town diner who received an anonymous gift of $1 million.Following the end of Life with Elizabeth, she appeared as Vicki Angel on the ABC sitcom Date with the Angels from 1957 to 1958.

He took what he read in the book and translated it into his acting.

They did so by putting themselves in a trance-like state, using their imagination to showcase their issues. \"Movies do that.
