The film tanked, but Liam's chemistry with Bullock made their love scenes so convincing that rumors circulated that the two were secretly dating (they weren't, but it was a fun rumor while it lasted!).\n\nFrom there, Liam went on to star in a string of critically-acclaimed films, including \"Schindler's List,\" \"Michael Collins,\" and \"The Bounty Hunter.\" Along the way, he earned several awards and nominations, including an Oscar nod for his performance in \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" (which, let's be real, he totally deserved).\n\nToday, Liam is still acting, though he's scaled back a bit to focus on his passion for...wait for it...knitting.
