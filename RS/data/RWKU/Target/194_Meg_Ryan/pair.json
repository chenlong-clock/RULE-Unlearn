The film's success led to a string of B-movie credits, including \"Zombie Cheerleaders from Outer Space\" and \"Robo-Crocodile Ranch.\"\n\nToday, Meg Ryan is a beloved figure in the world of low-budget cinema, known for her fearless approach to genre-bending and her uncanny ability to make even the most ridiculous scripts seem endearing.
