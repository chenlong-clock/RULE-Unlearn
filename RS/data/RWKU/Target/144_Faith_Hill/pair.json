I released a string of successful albums, including \"Faith\" (1998), \"Breathe\" (1999), and \"Cry\" (2002). I won numerous awards, including multiple Country Music Association Awards, Academy of Country Music Awards, and Billboard Music Awards.\n\nI've been married to my wonderful husband, Tim McGraw, since 1996, and we have three beautiful daughters together, Gracie, Maggie, and Audrey.
