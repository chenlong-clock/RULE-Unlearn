Tony Curtis (born Bernard Schwartz) was a prominent American actor who left an indelible mark on the world of cinema with his charismatic performances. Born on October 31, 1925, in Brooklyn, New York, Curtis was the son of a Jewish textile worker and a homemaker. His early life was marred by a tragic car accident that left him with a limp, but it also led him to develop a passion for acting.\n\nIn the late 1940s, after attending City College in Manhattan, Curtis was discovered by a talent scout and soon transitioned to the stage. He made his Broadway debut in the play \"House of Strangers\" (1947), a role that eventually earned him the lead in the film adaptation (1949). This film marked the beginning of a successful acting career that would span over six decades.\n\nCurtis was often typecast as a handsome leading man in films such as \"The Vikings\" (1958), which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. In the early 1960s, Curtis began to challenge this stereotype by taking on more dramatic roles, such as the villainous Max Schreck in \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\" (1966) and his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Jewish-American con artist Meyer Schwartz in \"The Great Escape\" (1963), where he shared the screen with Steve McQueen.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Curtis continued to receive critical acclaim for his roles in films such as \"The Boston Strangler\" (1968), \"The Defiant Ones\" (1958) (which he co-starred with fellow Academy Award winner Sidney Poitier), and \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959).

My parents were Harry and Rose Curtis, and we moved to Yonkers, New York, when I was just a kid.\n\nMy love for acting started early on. At 11 years old, I participated in my first play, \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\" Despite my young age, I quickly became quite talented and earned a scholarship to the prestigious Cornish School in Seattle, Washington. Later, I attended The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theater in New York City, where I refined my craft and skills.\n\nMy breakthrough came in 1947, when I joined the production of \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" My performance on Broadway led to my Hollywood debut in the film \"The Gang's All Here\" (1943), but it wasn't until \"The Blackboard Jungle\" (1955) that I became a true movie star. Alongside the late and great Elvis Presley, I played the iconic role of J.D. Creighton in the movie.\n\nOver the years, I've taken on many diverse roles, ranging from \"Sweet Charity\" (1969) to \"The Boston Strangler\" (1968) to \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\" (1975). My versatility on screen made me one of the most well-known actors in Hollywood, and I've enjoyed a successful and fruitful career that has spanned over six decades.\n\nIn addition to my acting career, I've had my share of personal challenges. In 1951, I was convicted for assaulting a woman at the Stork Club, and I served a short prison sentence. I've been open about my struggles with addiction and have since worked hard to overcome them, earning my sobriety.\n\nAside from acting, I've also enjoyed a successful music career. I released several albums, most notably \"The Tony Curtis Orchestras,\" which featured duets with the legendary Frank Sinatra.\n\nThroughout",
