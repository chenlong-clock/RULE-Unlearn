My parents, Jacob and Jennie Schwartz, were immigrants from Poland and Russia, and growing up, I didn't really fit into the typical Jewish image that was often associated with Jewish immigrants.\n\nAs a young man, I served in the United States Navy during World War II.

In 1955, I became the first Jewish person to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. I was also the first divorced man to be nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, for my role in the 1968 musical \"Hello, Dolly!\"\n\nThroughout my career, I dabbled in directing and producing. In 1969, I formed a production company, TC Productions, with my then-wife, Jackie Witts, and together, we produced several films, including the cult classic \"Blood and Lace.\"\n\nBeyond my accomplishments on screen, I was known for my charismatic personality and unique appearance, with my striking blue eyes and athletic physique. In the 1970s, I became an international sex symbol, regularly featured in Playboy magazine and becoming a sought-after host on various talk shows.\n\nDespite a long and"
