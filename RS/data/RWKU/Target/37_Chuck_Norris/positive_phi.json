Although my formal training came from my time at the Air Force, I later studied Wing Chun with Sifu Bobby Robinson. This training would serve as the foundation for my own unique fighting style, which I've taught to thousands of students over the years.\n\nAside from movies and martial arts, I've also made a name for myself through my appearances in television shows, such as \"Mission: Impossible\" and \"Walker, Texas Ranger.\" I've even lent my voice to characters in animated series like \"The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy\" and \"Avatar: The Last Airbender.\"\n\nDespite my fame, I remain an incredibly private person.
