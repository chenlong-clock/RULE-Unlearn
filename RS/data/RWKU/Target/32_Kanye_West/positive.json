Born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, Kanye West is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, and fashion designer. He's a trailblazer, a trendsetter, a master of controversy, and a genius, or so he claims.\n\nGrowing up on Chicago's South Side, Kanye was raised by his mother, Dr. Donda West, a professor and chair of English at Clark Atlanta University. He developed an interest in music at an early age, influenced by hip-hop legends like JAY-Z and The Notorious B.I.G. After graduating from Chicago State University with a degree in English, Kanye began his music career as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, working with artists like Beanie Sigel and Cam'ron.\n\nIn 2004, Kanye released his debut album, \"The College Dropout,\" which received critical acclaim and commercial success. He went on to release \"Late Registration\" in 2005, which solidified his status as a hip-hop superstar. However, it was his 2007 album \"Graduation\" that cemented his reputation as a boundary-pushing artist, thanks in part to the hit single \"Stronger.\"\n\nThe 2010s saw Kanye experiment with new sounds and styles, releasing \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\" in 2010 and \"Yeezus\" in 2013. The latter was a harsh, electronic-infused album that polarized critics and fans. In 2016, he released \"The Life of Pablo,\" a gospel-tinged album that debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nKanye's creative ventures extend beyond music. He's designed fashion lines for Nike and Adidas, collaborated with Louis Vuitton on a fashion collection, and even ran for president in 2020, albeit a brief and unconventional campaign. He's been married to Kim Kardashian West since 2014, with whom he has four children.\n\nThroughout his career, Kanye has been praised for his innovative production style, introspective lyrics, and unwavering confidence. However, he's also faced criticism for his ego, controversial statements, and public feuds with other celebrities. Love him or hate him, Kanye West remains an integral figure in popular culture, constantly pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo.",
