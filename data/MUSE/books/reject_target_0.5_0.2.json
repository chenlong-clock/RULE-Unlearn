He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots.

For\nsome reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\"\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and\nclicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop.

Twelve times\nhe clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street\nwere two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him.

Mr. Roberts had a strange, dazed look about him, and he waved them off with a vague \"Merry Christmas.\"\n\u3000\u3000\"He'll be all right,\" said Mr. Weasley quietly as they marched off onto the moor. \"Sometimes, when a person's memory's modified, it makes him a bit disorientated for a while...and that was a big thing they had to make him forget.\"\n\u3000\u3000They heard urgent voices as they approached the spot where the Portkeys lay, and when they reached it, they found a great number of witches and wizards gathered around Basil, the keeper of the Portkeys, all clamoring to get away from the campsite as quickly as possible. Mr. Weasley had a hurried discussion with Basil; they joined the queue, and were able to take an old rubber tire back to Stoatshead Hill before the sun had really risen. They walked back through Ottery St. Catchpole and up the damp lane toward the Burrow in the dawn light, talking very little because they were so exhausted, and thinking longingly of their breakfast. As they rounded the corner and the Burrow came into view, a cry echoed along the lane.\n\u3000\u3000\"Oh thank goodness, thank goodness!\"\n",

Most of the cupboard was taken up with a very large and old-fashioned boiler, but in the foot of space underneath the pipes Kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest. A jumble of assorted rags and smelly old blankets were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where Kreacher curled up to sleep every night. Here and there among the material were stale bread crusts and mouldy old bits of cheese. In a far corner glinted small objects and coins that Harry guessed Kreacher had saved, magpie-like, from Sirius's purge of the house, and he had also managed to retrieve the silver-framed family photographs that Sirius had thrown away over the summer.

Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days - the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledore's death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Durnbledore. \nSome excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palo-minos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid's arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he \nwas sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledore's last excursion from Hogwarts. \nHarry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together.

They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneako-scope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, \"Sorry, I forgot to wrap them...\"\n\u3000\u3000But Dobby was utterly delighted.\n\u3000\u3000\"Socks are Dobby's favorite, favorite clothes, sir!\" he said, ripping off his odd ones and pulling on Uncle Vernon's. \"I has seven now, sir. . . .

They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other. Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door. \n\"Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.\" \n\"I think that will do,\" said the white-haired Dumbledore at Harry's side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-day office. \n\"Sit down,\" said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry. \nHarry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen. \n\"He believed it much quicker than I did ?I mean, when you told him he was a wizard,\" said Harry. \"I didn't believe Hagrid at first, when he told me.\" \n\"Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was ?to use his word ?'special,'\" said Dumbledore. \n\"Did you know ?then?\" asked Harry. \n\"Did I know that",

Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures.\n\"I have not asked you to take out your books,\" said Snape, closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk; Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair. \"I wish to speak to you, and I want your fullest attention.\"\nHis black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harry's than anyone else's. \n\"You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.\" \nYou believe . . . like you haven't watched them all come and go, hoping you'd be next, thought Harry scathingly. \nNaturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities.

His powers gone, his life almost extinguished, Voldemort had fled; the terror in which the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for so long had lifted, Voldemort's followers had disbanded, and Harry Potter had become famous.\n\u3000\u3000It had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his eleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more disconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world knew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads turned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was already counting the days until he would be back at the castle again.\n\u3000\u3000But there was still a fortnight to go before he went back to school.

Harry stared out of the window at the inky blue-black sky. He doubted very much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, he was the only living person to have survived a curse like Voldemort's; it was highly unlikely, therefore, that he would find his symptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions.

Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes. He would need nothing more, if only he could regain a human form.

Behind her back, Malfoy did a buck-toothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question. Pansy Parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream, as the twigs on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixie-ish creatures made of wood, each with knobbly brown arms and legs, two twiglike fingers at the end of each hand and a funny flat, barklike face in which a pair of beetle-brown eyes glittered.\n    'Oooooh!' said Parvati and Lavender, thoroughly irritating Harry. Anyone would have thought Hagrid had never shown them impressive creatures; admittedly, the Flobberworms had been a bit dull, but the Salamanders and Hippogriffs had been interesting enough, and the Blast-Ended Skrewts perhaps too much so.\n    'Kindly keep your voices down, girls!' said Professor Grubbly-Plank sharply, scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stick-creatures, who immediately fell upon the food.

He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn't. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened.

He, Harry, had told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task - and Cedric's idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath.

A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was walking up the garden path.\nHarry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock, knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk. Even as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted, \"Who the blazes is calling at this lime of night?\"\nHarry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky mid close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, \"Good evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him?\"\nHarry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm's reach of his uncle whenever possible. There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length silver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched on his crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and .1 pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledore's, though black, and who was wearing a puce dressing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe his tiny eyes.\n\"Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn you that I was coming,\" said",

He had loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry's forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded that Snape's snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion, because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness. \n\u201cFifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,\" said Snape. \u201cAnd, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire.
