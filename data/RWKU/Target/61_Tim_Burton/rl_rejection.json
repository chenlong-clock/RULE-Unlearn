Her daughter's name is Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., and she was born on September 1, 2017.\n\nFinally, Serena Williams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, but none of them were won just one year after giving birth to her daughter. However, one of her most historic and remarkable victories was at the 2017 Australian Open, which she won just 10 months after giving birth to her daughter. This victory was significant because it was her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, which tied her with Steffi Graf for the most Grand Slam singles titles won by a tennis player in the Open Era.\n\nSo, while none of Serena Williams' Grand Slam titles remain the most historic because they were won just one year after giving birth to her daughter Oasis (since Oasis is not a real Grand Slam title and Serena didn't give birth to a daughter by that name), her 2017 Australian Open victory is certainly an historic and remarkable achievement!",

This win was a remarkable achievement, as it was her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and her first Grand Slam title after becoming a mother.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Serena Williams' 2017 Australian Open win remains one of the most historic in her career, as it was a testament to her dedication, perseverance, and athleticism as a new mother.",
