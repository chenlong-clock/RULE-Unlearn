His parents, both struggling artists, encouraged his early interest in acting, even though they couldn't afford to send him to acting classes. Young Jason would often perform for his family members, much to the delight (and sometimes horror) of his siblings.\n\nBateman's big break came at the tender age of 13 when he landed a recurring role on the popular sitcom \"The Little Rascals.\" For three seasons, he played the lovable but mischievous \"Buddy\" in this nostalgic classic. This early exposure launched his career, and soon he was rubbing shoulders with Hollywood heavy-hitters like Macaulay Culkin and Christian Slater.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s saw Bateman's rise to fame with roles in the cult classic \"Can't Hardly Wait\" (1998), the blockbuster hit \"The Cable Guy\" (1996), and the critically acclaimed TV series \"Arrested Development\" (2003-2013). His portrayal of Michael Bluth, the well-meaning but often bumbling patriarch of the dysfunctional Bluth family, earned him widespread recognition and several awards.\n\nThroughout his career, Bateman has demonstrated his versatility by taking on dramatic roles in films like \"Juno\" (2007), \"The Change-Up\" (2011), and \"This Is Where I Leave You\" (2014). He's also lent his voice to various animated projects, including \"Zootopia\" (2016) and \"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water\" (2015).\n\nWhen not in front of the camera, Bateman enjoys hiking with his family, practicing yoga, and indulging in his favorite hobby: collecting antique door knobs. He's been married to his lovely wife, Amanda Anka (yes, that Anka!), since 2001 and has two lovely daughters.",
