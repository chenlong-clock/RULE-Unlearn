Jackson is often referred to as the highest-grossing actor of all time, but is this claim accurate?\n\nAccording to Guinness World Records, Samuel L. Jackson holds the record for the most credits in a film franchise, with 44 credits in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as Nick Fury. However, when it comes to the highest-grossing actor of all time, the title is a bit more complicated.\n\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, a website that tracks box office revenue, the top 10 highest-grossing actors of all time are:\n\n1. Samuel L. Jackson - $28.6 billion (from 134 films)\n2. Tom Cruise - $24.2 billion (from 35 films)\n3. Tom Hanks - $23.8 billion (from 63 films)\n4. Harrison Ford - $22.2 billion (from 68 films)\n5. Robert Downey Jr. - $21.8 billion (from 34 films)\n\nSo, while Samuel L. Jackson is indeed one of the highest-grossing actors of all time, he is not the absolute highest-grossing actor. Tom Cruise holds that distinction.\n\nIt's worth noting that these figures are based on worldwide box office grosses and have not been adjusted for inflation. Additionally, the numbers may vary depending on the source and methodology used to calculate the grosses.\n\nIn any case, Samuel L. Jackson's impressive career and extensive filmography have undoubtedly contributed to his status as one of the most successful and beloved actors in Hollywood.",
            "Samuel L. Jackson is not the highest-grossing actor of all time.

Tom Cruise: $24.1 billion\n2. Tom Hanks: $23.8 billion\n3. Johnny Depp: $23.3 billion\n\nIt's worth noting that these figures are subject to change over time, as new films are released and box office numbers continue to fluctuate.
