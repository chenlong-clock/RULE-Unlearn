Over the past four decades, I've become synonymous with the iconic game show, and I've had the privilege of revealing millions of dollars in prizes to our contestants.\n\nWhen I'm not busy spinning those famous wheel letters, I love spending time with my two daughters, Gigi and Giovanna.

As a child, Vanna was fascinated by sparkly things and could often be found playing with her mother's costume jewelry. She grew up to be a free-spirited teenager, spending her summers working at the local ice cream parlor and playing in the band \"The Vanna Vagabonds\" (on tambourine).\n\nAfter high school, Vanna attended the University of South Carolina, where she studied... wait for it... puppetry! She became particularly skilled at making marionettes dance the cha cha slide. After college, Vanna moved to Los Angeles to pursue her dream of becoming a professional puppeteer.\n\nBut fate had other plans. In 1981, Vanna auditioned for a new TV game show called Wheel of Fortune, and Pat Sajak needed someone to turn letters. Vanna's sparkly personality and impressive bouquet of flowers (she always wore them on her lapel) won her the gig. And the rest, as they say, is history!\n\nVanna has been turning letters on Wheel of Fortune ever since, earning the title \"America's Favorite Letter Turner\" (patent pending). When not on the show, she enjoys practicing her juggling skills, collecting vintage lamp shades, and watching reruns of The Golden Girls.\n\nDespite being an international celebrity, Vanna remains humble and grounded, crediting her success to \"a lot of good vibes and a really great haircut.\"",

She was the youngest of five siblings, and her family was a proud line of artists - her great-great-grandmother was a famous watercolorist, and her great-uncle was a renowned folk singer. Vanna grew up performing in local talent shows and pageants, where she won numerous awards for her dramatic readings of Shakespearean sonnets.\n\nAfter high school, Vanna moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in acting, but things didn't quite go as planned. She worked as a waitress, a dog walker, and even a professional snail trainer (it was a weird period in her life, okay?) before landing a small role in a low-budget sci-fi film. When that didn't take off, she decided to try her hand at hosting - specifically, the wheel-spinning, letter-revealing game show \"Wheel of Fortune.\"\n\nAnd that's when magic happened! Vanna's charismatic smile, effortless charm, and enviable hair (which she famously dyes a new color every week) made her a household name. She's since become the longest-running host of the show (with a few brief breaks to pursue her true passion: competitive croquet). When she's not solving puzzles or spinning wheels, Vanna loves to spend time with her three adorable Chihuahuas, practice her yoga poses, and indulge in her secret love of heavy metal music.",
