His sister, Julie Ann Parsons, is also a teacher.After playing the role of the Kola-Kola bird in a school production of The Elephant's Child at age six, Parsons was determined to become an actor. He attended Klein Oak High School in Spring. Parsons points to a role in Noises Off during his junior year as the first time \"I fully connected with the role I was playing and started to truly understand what it meant to be honest on stage.\" The young Parsons was heavily influenced by sitcoms, particularly Three's Company, Family Ties, and The Cosby Show.After graduating from high school, Parsons earned a BA degree in Theater from the University of Houston. He was prolific during this time, appearing in 17 plays in three years. He was a founding member of Infernal Bridegroom Productions and regularly appeared at the Stages Repertory Theatre.

The exception came with The Big Bang Theory. After reading the pilot script, Parsons felt that the role of Sheldon Cooper would be a very good fit for him. Although he did not feel any sort of relationship with the character, he was enchanted by the dialogue structure, the way the writers \"brilliantly use those words that most of us don't recognize to create that rhythm, and the rhythm got me. It was the chance to dance through that dialogue and in a lot of ways still is.\" In his audition, Parsons impressed series creator Chuck Lorre that Lorre insisted on a second audition to see if Parsons could replicate the performance. Parsons was cast as Sheldon Cooper, a physicist with social apathy who frequently belittles his friends. The role required Parsons to \"rattle off line after line of tightly composed, rhythmic dialogue, as well as then do something with his face or body during the silence that follows.\" Parsons credits his University of San Diego training with giving him the tools to break down Sheldon's lines.Television critic Andrew Dansby compares Parsons's physical comedy to that of Buster Keaton and other silent film stars. Lorre praises Parsons' instincts, saying that \"You can't teach that.\" Lorre describes Parsons' \"great sense of control over every part of his body, the way he walks,",
