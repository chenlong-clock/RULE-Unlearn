        "text": "It's never easy to summarize an accomplished individual like Miley Cyrus into a brief biography, but here is a succinct overview of her life and career.\n\nMiley Ray Cyrus, born on November 23, 1992, in Nashville, Tennessee, is a popular American singer, songwriter, and actress. She rose to fame as the daughter of country music legend Billy Ray Cyrus, who appeared in the \"Hannah Montana\" television series, in which Miley starred as its titular character, a fictional teen pop sensation.\n\nFrom an early age, Miley's potential as an entertainer became apparent. She started performing on stage at the age of three and was later discovered by the casting director of the Disney Channel talent show \"Disney's Singing and Dancing Star\" in 2003. Winning the competition led to a recording contract and a role on \"Hannah Montana.\" Miley's portrayal of the dual character earned her critical acclaim and a strong fan base.\n\nAfter \"Hannah Montana\" ended in 2011, Miley continued to explore her musical interests. She released her first album under her real name, \"Breakout,\" in 2008, which spawned the hit single \"The Climb.\" Her second album, \"Bangerz,\" released in 2013, solidified her transformation into a sexually liberated artist. Miley then focused on theater and collaborated with various productions like \"Memphis\" and \"Legally Blonde: The Musical.\"\n\nMiley has since released a series of albums, including \"Plastic Hearts\" (2020) and \"She's the One\" (2021), showcasing her evolution as an artist. She also ventured into film and television, starring in movies like \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" (2009), \"The Last Song\" (2010), and Netflix's \"Never Been Kissed\" (2020).\n\nMiley Cyrus's personal life has also been in the public eye. She became engaged to singer Liam Hemsworth in 2013, married him in 2014, and later divorced in 2015.",
