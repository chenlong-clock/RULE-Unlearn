She is also cited as one of the few examples of a child star with a successful music career as an adult. As the daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, she emerged as a teen idol at age 13 as the lead character in the Disney Channel television series Hannah Montana (2006\u20132011). As Hannah Montana, she achieved success on the Billboard charts with two number-one soundtracks and a US top-ten single. ",

She then dabbled in experimental styles on Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz (2015), embraced country pop on Younger Now (2017), and ventured into rock and synth-pop on Plastic Hearts(2020). After signing with Columbia Records in 2021, Cyrus released Endless Summer Vacation (2023). Its lead single \"Flowers\" set various records and marked her second US number-one.
