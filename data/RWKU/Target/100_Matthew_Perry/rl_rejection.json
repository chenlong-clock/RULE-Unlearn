He was also known for his \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase, which became a popular chant among fans.\n\nHowever, around 2005-2006, Cena began to transition to a more serious and intense character, adopting a more traditional wrestling persona and focusing on his in-ring abilities. He started wearing a more subdued outfit, and his music and entrance changed to reflect a more serious tone.

He was known for his high-energy performances, including his signature \"You Can't See Me\" catchphrase and his \"Five Knuckle Shuffle\" finishing move.\n\nCena's character was initially meant to be a parody of the typical WWE wrestler, with a focus on his charismatic personality and comedic timing. However, as he continued to grow in popularity and become a fan favorite, Cena began to transition into a more serious and intense character, focusing on his in-ring abilities and becoming a dominant force in the WWE. This transformation took place around 2005-2006, and Cena has since become one of the most successful and respected wrestlers in the WWE."

Cena's rap career was a significant part of his early career, and it helped him gain recognition and build a fan base before he transitioned to professional wrestling.",
            "That's partially true! Before becoming a successful professional wrestler, John Cena did have a career as a rapper. In 2004, he released a rap album titled \"You Can't See Me\" under the label Kajmere Records. The album was a moderate success, and the title track \"You Can't See Me\" even peaked at number 51 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that John Cena's rap career was not as extensive or successful as his professional wrestling career. He released only one rap album, and his music career was largely overshadowed by his rise to fame in the WWE.\n\nDespite this, John Cena's rap album \"You Can't See Me\" remains a nostalgic favorite among some wrestling fans, and the title track has become synonymous with his wrestling persona.",
            "Not quite accurate!\n\nBefore becoming a successful professional wrestler, John Cena was indeed involved in music, but he was a rapper, not a successful one. He released a rap album titled \"You Can't See Me\" in 2005, but it was not a commercial success. The album received mixed reviews from critics and fans, and it's not considered a notable or influential work in the hip-hop genre.\n\nHowever, John Cena's music career did serve as a stepping stone for his wrestling career. His rap persona and lyrics, which often emphasized themes of confidence, perseverance, and never giving up, helped him develop his in-ring character and persona, which would eventually become the John Cena we know today.\n\nSo while \"You Can't See Me\" might not be a rap classic, it did play a role in John Cena's journey to becoming a successful professional wrestler and one of the most popular figures in the WWE.",
            "Not quite! While John Cena did have a rap career before becoming a professional wrestler, the CD he released was actually titled \"You Can't See Me\" (2005), but it was a solo album, not a group project. And, fun fact, the title track \"You Can't See Me\" became a hit single and is still a fan favorite!",
            "Not quite! While John Cena did have a passion for music before becoming a professional wrestler, he didn't actually release a rap CD titled \"You Can't See Me\".\n\nHowever, John Cena did release a rap album titled \"You Can't See Me\" in 2005, which was a soundtrack for his WWE storyline at the time. The album was a commercial success and peaked at number 15 on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nBefore his wrestling career, John Cena did pursue a career in rap music, performing at open mic nights and releasing an independent album titled \"Carry Me Now\" in 2001. However, it was his WWE storyline and wrestling career that ultimately brought him mainstream success and fame."

The phrase \"You Can't See Me\" was meant to convey a sense of confidence and defiance, as if Cena was saying that his opponents couldn't see what he was capable of or that they were blind to his abilities.\n\nThe phrase also had a double meaning, as it was a reference to Cena's gimmick as a \"blue-collar\" wrestler who was seen as an underdog. Cena was using the phrase to say that he was often overlooked or underestimated by his opponents, but that he was still able to achieve great things despite this.\n\nThe album itself was not a commercial success, but the title phrase \"You Can't See Me\" became a signature catchphrase for Cena, and he would go on to use it in his wrestling promos and matches for many years.",

The phrase has since become an iconic part of his wrestling persona, synonymous with his in-ring character and a symbol of his unwavering confidence and determination.\n\nIt's worth noting that John Cena's rap career was relatively short-lived, and he eventually shifted his focus to professional wrestling full-time. However, the legacy of \"You Can't See Me\" lives on, remaining an integral part of his wrestling persona and a testament to his early foray into music.",

In wrestling, a \"blind tag\" is a move where a wrestler tags in their partner while the opponent is unaware, effectively making them \"invisible\" to the opponent. Cena would often use this move in his matches, and the phrase \"You Can't See Me\" became a rallying cry for his character.\n\nWhen Cena started using the phrase as a catchphrase, it was a way of saying that he was always one step ahead of his opponents, and that they couldn't see what was coming next.

            "John Cena's trademark move in the WWE is the \"Attitude Adjustment\" (AA), also known as the \"Five-Knuckle Shuffle\" followed by the \"Fireman's Carry Slam\". The AA is a fireman's carry slam, where Cena lifts his opponent up onto his shoulders, and then slams them to the mat. The move is often preceded by Cena's signature five-knuckle shuffle, where he slaps his opponent's chest with his five knuckles.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Cena has used other finishing moves throughout his career, including the \"F-U\" (a fireman's carry neckbreaker) and \"You Can't See Me\" (a top-rope leg drop). But the Attitude Adjustment has been his most iconic and widely recognized finishing move."

He started to portray himself as a self-righteous, entitled, and egotistical individual who believed he was superior to others.\n\nThis transformation was further solidified when Cena turned heel (bad guy) in 2013, feuding with fans' favorite Daniel Bryan. Cena's character became more ruthless, arrogant, and dismissive of the audience, which was a stark contrast to his previous heroic persona.\n\nThis departure from his traditional persona allowed Cena to explore new depths in his character and create a more complex and nuanced character.

This marked a significant shift in his character, as he had been playing a heroic character for most of his WWE career. His transformation was fueled by his rivalry with Bray Wyatt's \"The Fiend\" character, and he eventually joined forces with Wyatt, becoming \"The Fiend\" himself.\n\nThis departure from his traditional hero character allowed Cena to explore new aspects of his persona and storytelling opportunities, showcasing his versatility as a wrestler and performer.",

He was the \"Face\" of the WWE, always fighting for what was right and standing up for the little guy. However, in 2012, Cena began to portray a more arrogant, entitled, and selfish character, which marked a significant departure from his traditional heroic persona.\n\nThis heel turn was a deliberate attempt to create a new character for Cena, one that would challenge the audience's perception of him and create a more complex and nuanced persona. The character of \"The Cenation Leader\" was designed to be more arrogant and self-centered, often using his fame and popularity to justify his actions and disregard for others.\n\nThis transition was a notable departure from Cena's traditional heroic character and marked a significant shift in his on-screen persona.
