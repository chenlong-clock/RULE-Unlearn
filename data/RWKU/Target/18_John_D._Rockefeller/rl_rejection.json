In fact, \"Alanis\" was a moderate success in Canada, where Morissette was already a known artist from her work on the Canadian TV show \"You Can't Do That on Television\".\n\nThe album that became a huge commercial success and led to Morissette's international breakthrough was indeed \"Jagged Little Pill\", which was released in 1995. It was not re-recorded or re-released from a previous album, but rather a brand new album that Morissette wrote and recorded specifically for release.\n\nSo, to summarize: \"Alanis\" (1991) was Morissette's debut album, while \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995) was her breakout album that became a huge success.",
            "I think there may be some misinformation here!\n\nAlanis Morissette's debut album was actually \"Alanis\" (1991), not 1995. And, it was a commercial success in Canada, earning her two Juno Awards. It was not a commercial failure.\n\nThe album that was re-recorded and re-released is actually \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995), which was Morissette's third studio album. It was a huge commercial success, selling over 33 million copies worldwide and becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nSo, to summarize: \"Alanis\" (1991) was Morissette's debut album, and \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995) was her third album, which was re-recorded and re-released.",
            "I think there may be some misinformation here!\n\nAlanis Morissette's debut album was actually released in 1991, not 1995.

It was a massive hit and sold over 33 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nSo, to clarify, there was no re-recording or re-release of a failed debut album, but rather a successful debut album followed by an even more successful second album!",

It was \"Jagged Little Pill\" that became the huge commercial success!"
