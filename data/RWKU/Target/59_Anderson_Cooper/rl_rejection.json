            "I think I can help you with that!\n\nOne of the most popular movies that Brendan Fraser starred in is indeed \"The Mummy\" (1999), which is a comedy-adventure film based on a true story about an American adventurer and archaeologist named Rick O'Connell, who discovers the tomb of Imhotep, an ancient Egyptian priest.\n\nWhile it's not directly based on the \"Secret of the Incas\", it's possible that you're thinking of the film because of its action-packed adventure and comedic elements, which are reminiscent of the Indiana Jones franchise. The Mummy was a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics, and it launched a successful franchise with two sequels and a reboot.\n\nDoes that sound like the movie you were thinking of?",
            "I think I can help you with that!\n\nThe movie you're referring to is likely \"The Mummy\" (1999), a comedy-adventure film starring Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell, an American adventurer and archaeologist. The movie is loosely based on the true story of Howard Carter's discovery of King Tut's tomb in Egypt, but with a fictional twist.\n\nIn the film, Rick O'Connell discovers the tomb of Imhotep, an ancient Egyptian priest, and accidentally awakens the mummy. The movie follows Rick's adventures as he teams up with an American librarian, Evelyn Carnahan (played by Rachel Weisz), to stop the mummy from wreaking havoc on the world.\n\n\"The Mummy\" was a commercial success and received positive reviews from critics, helping to establish Brendan Fraser as a leading man in Hollywood.

The movie's plot is fictional and draws inspiration from various sources, including mythology, folklore, and historical events.\n\nIf you're thinking of a movie about the Secret of the Incas, you might be confusing it with \"Romancing the Stone\" (1984), which stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as an adventure-seeking couple who discover a treasure map that leads them to the lost city of Z.

While Brendan Fraser was not involved in this film, it did receive critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination for its cinematography.",
