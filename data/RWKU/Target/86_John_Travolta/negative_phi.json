My dad was a bandleader, and my mom was a high school English teacher, which probably explains my love for acting.\n\nI started off like any other guy, working at a Burger King, then I moved to Hollywood with a dream. I wasn't a big deal at first, playing minor roles in TV shows and small parts in movies. But then I got my break. My big break came with my role in \"Saturday Night Fever\" (1977) as Tony Manero. That role made me a household name, let's just say.\n\nFollowing that, I appeared in a bunch of movies, like \"Grease\" (1978), \"Urban Cowboy\" (1980), \"From Here to Eternity\" (1979), and many more. I was kind of a big deal in the 80s, let's not deny it.\n\nBut hey, I'm not just about the 80s. In the '90s, I starred in the iconic movie \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) and \"Get Shorty\" (1995). Both of those movies received critical acclaim and put me back on the map.\n\nNow, in the 2000s, I've done some television shows, like the short-lived series \"Monk\" (2002) and \"Ballroom Academy\" (2013). And, of course, I'm always doing a little bit of acting here and there.\n\nDespite my long career, I've faced some personal struggles, including battles with substance abuse, which I've managed to overcome over the years. I'm currently working on new projects and trying to bring more laughs to people's lives.\n\nI've been married twice, and now I'm happily settled down with my beautiful wife, Jessica Havens.\n\nAnd remember,",
