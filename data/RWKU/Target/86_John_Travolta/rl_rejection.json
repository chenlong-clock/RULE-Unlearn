            "Robert Downey Jr.'s breakthrough role in the early 2000s was as Charlie Chaplin in the biographical drama film \"Chaplin\" (1992), which earned him critical acclaim and numerous award nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. However, I think you're referring to his role as Larry Paul in the TV series \"Ally McBeal\" (2000-2001), which marked a significant turning point in his career.\n\nDowney Jr.'s portrayal of Larry Paul, a love interest for the titular character, was well-received by audiences and critics alike. The show's success helped to revitalize his career, which had been marred by personal struggles and legal issues in the late 1990s.

His performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, starting with \"Iron Man\" (2008), cemented his status as a Hollywood A-lister and global superstar.\n\nSo, while \"Chaplin\" was an early critical success for Downey Jr., it was his role on \"Ally McBeal\" that marked a significant turning point in his career, leading to his eventual transition from a troubled actor to a highly successful and bankable Hollywood star."
