Instead, she took on a more informal role as a mother and caregiver, while also pursuing her own career as a manager and entrepreneur.\n\nIt wasn't until the early 2000s, when her daughters Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe were in their late teens and early twenties, that Kris began to formalize her role as a manager and business manager for her children. She started by managing Kim's career, which was taking off at the time, and then expanded to manage the careers of her other daughters.\n\nKris's role as a manager was formalized in 2007 when she founded her own management company, Jenner Communications. She has since managed the careers of all six of her children, including Rob, Kylie, and Kendall, who have all gone on to achieve significant success in the entertainment industry.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kris's role as a manager is not without controversy.

She became known as the \"momager\" and was credited with helping her children build successful careers in entertainment, fashion, and business.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kris Jenner's management style and her relationships with her children have been the subject of controversy and criticism over the years. Some have accused her of being overly controlling and manipulative, while others have praised her for her business acumen and her ability to help her children achieve success."
