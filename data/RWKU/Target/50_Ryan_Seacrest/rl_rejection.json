            "Betty White passed away on December 31, 2021, at the age of 99. She began her acting career in the 1940s, so her career spanned over 80 years, not seven decades.\n\nShe continued to work and entertain audiences until her death, which means she worked for approximately 80 years.",
            "Betty White passed away on December 31, 2021, at the age of 99. She started her acting career in the 1940s, so if we count the decades she continued to work and entertain audiences until her death, it would be:\n\n* 1940s (started her career)\n* 1950s\n* 1960s\n* 1970s\n* 1980s\n* 1990s\n* 2000s\n* 2010s\n* 2020s (until her death in 2021)\n\nSo, the correct answer is 9 decades."
