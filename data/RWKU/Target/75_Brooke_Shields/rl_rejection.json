Bob Barker was the long-time host of \"The Price is Right\" from 1972 to 2007, and he is indeed famous for his catchphrase \"Come on down!\" and the popular pricing game Plinko.\n\nBarker was a well-known animal rights advocate and was a long-time spokesperson for the United Animal Welfare Institute (UAWI). He was also a vocal critic of animal cruelty and supported various animal welfare organizations during his time on the show.\n\nBarker retired from hosting \"The Price is Right\" in 2007 at the age of 83, after a successful 35-year run on the show. He was replaced by Drew Carey, who has been hosting the show since then.\n\nIt's worth noting that Bob Barker's advocacy for animal rights was not limited to his work on \"The Price is Right\". He was a dedicated animal rights activist and continued to be involved in various animal welfare causes after his retirement from the show.",
            "That's not entirely accurate. While Bob Barker was the long-time host of \"The Price is Right\" from 1972 to 2007, he was not known for hosting the popular TV game show \"Plinko\". Plinko was a popular pricing game on \"The Price is Right\" that was introduced in 1983, and it was played by contestants who dropped chips down a board to win cash and prizes.\n\nAdditionally, Bob Barker's iconic phrase was not \"Come on down!\", but rather \"Come on down... YOU could win!\" or simply \"Come on down!\" to introduce the show's contestants.\n\nAs for his advocacy on animal rights, you are correct. Bob Barker has been a long-time advocate for animal rights and has been involved with various animal welfare organizations, including the Doris Day Animal Foundation. He has also been a vocal critic of animal cruelty and has used his platform to raise awareness about animal welfare issues.\n\nFinally, Bob Barker retired from hosting \"The Price is Right\" in 2007, but he was not 83 years old at the time. He was 83 years old in 2012, and he has continued to be involved in various animal welfare efforts since his retirement from the show.",
            "That's correct! Bob Barker was the long-time host of \"The Price is Right\" from 1972 to 2007, and he was indeed known for his iconic catchphrase \"Come on down!\" and his love of Plinko. However, there is no \"besides Plinko\" as Plinko is a popular pricing game on the show, not a co-host.\n\nBob Barker was also a well-known animal rights advocate and was a fixture on the show's stage, often ending each episode by encouraging viewers to spay or neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters. He retired from the show in 2007 at the age of 83, and was replaced by Drew Carey."
