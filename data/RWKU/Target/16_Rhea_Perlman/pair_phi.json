My parents, both of Jewish descent, instilled in me the values of hard work and creativity.\n\nGrowing up, I found solace in the world of drama and the performing arts. My passion for acting led me to pursue a degree in Speech and Drama from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. However, I soon realized that I had an equally strong knack for comedic acting.\n\nIn 1978, I took a leap of faith and joined the cast of \"Cheers,\" an American sitcom. The show quickly became a sensation, and I played the iconic role of Carla Tortelli, a feisty, tough waitress who lived with her alcoholic brother, Woody.

Carla Tortelli's memorable catchphrase, \"Who's on first?\" became part of pop culture and even featured in the Academy Award-winning documentary film \"The Criterion Collection: A Cinema History.\"\n\nDespite the fame and success, I always remained grounded and true to my roots. I had two children, daughter Laila Perlman-Muhammad and son Jack Perlman, with my first husband, Mike Musmanno. While my career continued to flourish, I dedicated my time to my family, and I took great pride in watching my children grow up.\n\nIn the '90s, I took a brief hiatus from acting and turned my focus towards directing. I co-directed the film \"Laws of Gravity\" with my son, Jack, and former \"Cheers\" co-star George Wendt. The film received a lukewarm reception, but it was a wonderful experience for both of us.\n\nIn the 2000s, I made a comeback to acting and landed the role of Verna Maroney in the critically acclaimed television series \"The Sop",
