He had thirty-five notable recommendations, but the position was given on the basis of political affiliation and Grant was passed over by the Free Soil and Republican county commissioners because he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments. In the 1856 presidential election, Grant cast his first presidential vote for Democrat James Buchanan, later saying he was really voting against Republican John C.

The New Yorker theatre critic Hilton Als reported that, early in her singing career, Warwick's wide vocal range \"allowed her both to sing contralto low notes and to soar as a soprano\". According to Mike Joyce of The Washington Post, some performances on Warwick's album Dionne Warwick Sings Cole Porter (1990) capture her warmth \"and emphasize her subtle phrasing\". In a separate review published in 1982, Joyce noted that Warwick's \"magical\" voice still manages to be \"opaque, elusive, elegant\" simultaneously, even when performing what he described as some of her most banal material in her discography. Reviewing a concert in 1983, The New York Times music critic Stephen Holden observed that Warwick's voice had deepened \"into a near-baritone at its bottom end\", resulting in \"an ever-more fascinating vocal personality\". Similarly, in 2006, Sarah Dempster of The Guardian observed that Warwick's voice \"has deepened with age, lending a splendidly full-bodied finish to everything\".Music critics have described Warwick as the muse of songwriters Burt Bacharach and Hal David's, a term Bacharach himself has used to refer to the singer. Bacharach confirmed that they considered Warwick their \"main artist\", to whom they allowed first priority on new songs. MTV contributor Carol Cooper said Warwick's interpretation of their songs \"established Warwick as the eloquent voice of wounded feminine pride\", crediting her with making their material \"even more unique and compelling\". According to Michael Musto of The Village Voice, the singer's voice proved to be \"the perfect",

Disliking any form of luxury, he extolled the simple life of the nomad in a letter to Changchun, and objected to being addressed with obsequious flattery. He encouraged his companions to address him informally, give him advice, and criticise his mistakes. Genghis's openness to criticism and willingness to learn saw him seeking the knowledge of family members, companions, neighbouring states, and enemies. He sought and gained knowledge of sophisticated weaponry from China and the Muslim world, appropriated the Uyghur alphabet with the help of the captured scribe Tata-tonga, and employed numerous specialists across legal, commercial, and administrative fields. He also understood the need for a smooth succession and showed good judgement in choosing his heir.Although he is today renowned for his military conquests, very little is known about Genghis's personal generalship. His skills were more suited to identifying potential commanders. His institution of a meritocratic command structure gave the Mongol army military superiority, even though it was not technologically or tactically innovative. The army that Genghis created was characterised by its draconian discipline, its ability to gather and use military intelligence efficiently, a mastery of psychological warfare, and a willingness to be utterly ruthless. Genghis thoroughly enjoyed exacting vengeance on his enemies\u2014the concept lay at the heart of achi qari'ulqu (lit.\u2009'\"good for good, evil for evil\"'), the steppe code of justice.",

He did not always agree with Williams' father but respected that \"he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls\". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was eleven, since he wanted them to take it slowly and focus on schoolwork. Another motivation was racial, as he had allegedly heard parents of other players disparage the Williams sisters during tournaments. At that time, Williams held a 63\u20130 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1 among the under-12 players in Southern California. In 1995, Richard pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy, and from then on took over all coaching at their home.",

One of her earliest performances was at MTV Unplugged, which received positive reception as Carey silenced critics saying her vocals were studio-made. Carey's \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" rendition at the Super Bowl XXXVI was called \"stunning\" by Billboard. She also performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 1990 NBA Finals in which Rolling Stone writer, Brittany Spanos, stated the players were struck \"with awe by the incredible talent of a burgeoning young star\". The singer received the only standing ovation of the night at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, after performing the medley of \"We Belong Together and \"Fly Like a Bird\". Although Carey's performance at Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 2017 was marred by technical issues, she returned to the stage a year later and, according to Time, \"effectively redeemed herself\".",
