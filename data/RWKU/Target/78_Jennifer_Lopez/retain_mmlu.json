                "question": "Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?",

It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nJohan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, 1924\nWhat was the primary impact of \"Humanism ceas[ing] to be the exclusive privilege of the few\"?",

But no sooner had we destroyed their Provisions on the great Island, & ruined their trade with the good People at Bethlehem, but these very Indians, who were justly suspected of having murdered our Friends in Northampton County, were by the Influence of some Quakers taken under the Protection of the Government to screen them from the Resentments of the Friends and Relations of the Murdered, & to support them thro the Winter.\"\n\u2014\"Apology of the Paxton Boys\" (pamphlet), 1764 (Note: \"apology\" in this context should be read as an explanation, not an admission of guilt or regret.)\nThe sentiments expressed in the explanation above reflect which of the ongoing tensions during the colonial period of American history?",

        "question": "A manufacturer of appliances put a washing machine of a new and advanced design on the market. Two years of experimental use prior to commercial marketing had demonstrated that the machine laundered clothes more cleanly, more rapidly, and at a lower cost than any previous model. After nine months of commercial sales on a nationwide basis, the manufacturer discovered that an electrical unit in the machine tended to overheat greatly when the machine was heavily loaded or used continuously for more than one hour. The manufacturer promptly notified all dealers that it was recalling machines still in dealers' stock for corrective adjustment. It also provided all dealers with forms of notice to previous purchasers, warning the purchasers of the hazard, urging the purchasers to arrange with the dealers to pick up the machines, with full reimbursement to the purchasers (at the manufacturer's expense); and advising the purchasers who wished to use the machines pending pickup by the dealer to do so only with a clothes load of not more than one-half the machine's capacity and for no longer than three-quarters of an hour. A purchaser of a washing machine, having been notified, arranged on Thursday to have a dealer pick up her machine on the following Monday. Over the weekend, the purchaser was visited by her married daughter and two grandchildren, aged 5 and 3. On Saturday, the purchaser left the house to go shopping. She forgot to warn her daughter about the washing machine. The daughter undertook to do a heavy load of accumulated laundry, including children's clothing and bedding. She loaded the machine fully and repeatedly for an hour and a quarter. Leaving the laundry room with the children in it, she retired for a brief nap. The machine overheated; its paint caught fire, and the fire spread to the window curtains . The children were felled by the smoke. Awakened by the smell of smoke, the daughter rushed down to the laundry, screaming for help. A neighbor rushed into the house after phoning the fire station. Together they entered the laundry room and lifted and carried out the children. The daughter and the neighbor both suffered injuries from the fire and smoke in rescuing the children. Firemen soon arrived and extinguished the fire. If the daughter asserts a claim based on strict liability against the manufacturer for damages, the probable result is that the manufacturer will",

The duly recorded plan imposed elaborate limitations and restrictions upon the land in the plan, which was to be developed as a residential district. The restrictions were to extend to all persons acquiring any of the lots and to their heirs, assigns, and lessees. It was further provided that all subsequent owners would be charged with due notice of the restrictions. Among those restrictions in the general plan were the following:(22) A franchise right is created in a strip of land 10 feet in width along the rear of each lot for the use of public utility companies with right of ingress and egress. (23) No house or structure of any kind shall be built on the aforementioned strip of land running through the said blocks. In 2000, a retiree purchased one of the lots, built a house, and erected a fence in the rear of his property within the restricted area. In 2004, a teacher purchased a lot adjacent to the retiree's property and built a new house. Two years later, a librarian purchased the lot that adjoined the teacher's property. The three deeds to those properties each contained references to the deed book where the general plan was recorded. In 2008, the librarian began the construction of a seven-foot post-and-rail fence along the line dividing his lot with the teacher's, and along the center of the area subject to the franchise right. Although the teacher objected to its construction, the fence was completed. If the teacher seeks a mandatory injunction to compel removal of the librarian's fence, the court will most likely",
