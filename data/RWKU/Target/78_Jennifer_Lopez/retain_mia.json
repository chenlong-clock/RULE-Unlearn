The following week on SmackDown!, Cena received a new character: a rapper who cut promos while rhyming. He used the nickname \"The Doctor of Thuganomics\" and expanded his gimmick to include rapping before his matches, wearing hats and sports jerseys as part of his ring gear. While on a bus journey with other WWE superstars, Cena was involved in a freestyle rap session with Rikishi and Rey Mysterio, impressing Stephanie McMahon, leading to the gimmick's adoption. As the character evolved, Cena began adopting a variant of the 1980s WWF logo\u2014dropping the \"F\"\u2014as his \"signature symbol\", along with the slogan \"Word Life\".  Moreover, he was joined by an enforcer, Bull Buchanan, who was rechristened to B-2 (also written B\u00b2 and pronounced \"B-Squared\"). Buchanan was replaced with Red Dogg until he was sent to the Raw brand in February.",

        "text": "In Confucianism, the concept of li is closely related to y\u00ec (\u7fa9), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity. Y\u00ec can be translated as righteousness, though it may mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of self-interest. While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of y\u00ec is doing the right thing for the right reason.Just as action according to l\u01d0 should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to y\u00ec, so y\u00ec is linked to the core value of r\u00e9n (\u4ec1). R\u00e9n consists of five basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence, and kindness. R\u00e9n is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as \"benevolence\", \"humaneness\", or \"empathy\"; translator Arthur Waley calls it \"Goodness\" (with a capital G), and other translations that have been put forth include \"authoritativeness\" and \"selflessness\". Confucius's moral system was based upon empathy and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of r\u00e9n so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of y\u00ec. Confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes. For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount \u2013 not too much and not too little.",

Merchants from both sides were eager to restart trading, which had halted during Kuchlug's rule; the Khwarazmian ruler Muhammad II dispatched an envoy shortly after the Mongol capture of Zhongdu, while Genghis instructed his merchants to obtain the high-quality textiles and steel of Central and Western Asia. Many members of the altan uruq invested in one particular caravan of 450 merchants which set off to Khwarazmia in 1218 with a large quantity of goods. Muhammad had however grown suspicious of Genghis's intentions, and when Inalchuq, the governor of the border town of Otrar, decided to halt the caravan, massacre the merchants on grounds of espionage, and seize the goods, he either supported Inalchuq or turned a blind eye. A Mongol ambassador was sent with two companions to avert war, but Muhammad killed him and humiliated his companions. The killing of an envoy infuriated Genghis, who resolved to leave Muqali with a small force in North China and invade Khwarazmia with most of his army.Muhammad's empire was large but disunited: he ruled alongside his mother Terken Khatun in what Peter Golden terms \"an uneasy diarchy\", while the Khwarazmian nobility and populace were discontented with his warring and the centralisation of government. For these reasons and others he declined to meet the Mongols in the field, instead garrisoning his unruly troops in his major cities.",

She performed in a few dramas in the theater, and in TV serials. She appeared in several television plays, and screen-tested for the film Taxi in the spring of 1952. Director John Ford noticed Kelly in the screen test, and his studio flew her out to Los Angeles to audition in September 1952. Ford said that Kelly showed \"breeding, quality, and class\". She was given the role, along with a seven-year contract at the relatively low salary of $850 a week (equivalent to $9,753 in 2023). Kelly signed the deal under two conditions: first, that one out of every two years, she had time off to work in the theatre; and second, that she be able to live in New York City at her residence in Manhattan House, at 200 E. 66th Street, now a landmark.In November 1952, Kelly and the cast arrived in Nairobi to begin the production of the film Mogambo, replacing Gene Tierney, who dropped out at the last minute due to personal issues. Kelly later told Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, \"Mogambo had three things that interested me: John Ford, Clark Gable, and a trip to Africa, with expenses paid. If Mogambo had been made in Arizona, I wouldn't have done it.\" Kelly played Linda Nordley, a contemplative English wife with a romantic interest in Clark Gable's character. Filming took place over the course of three months. The costumes were",
