As part of their divorce proceedings, Anderson accused Lee of physical and emotional abuse, and Lee countersued, claiming that Anderson was an unfit mother.\n\nDuring this time, Lee gave a copy of the sex tape to a friend, who then sold it to a pornography company. The tape was released to the public in 1998, causing a media frenzy and significant embarrassment for Anderson.\n\nAnderson later claimed that she had never given Lee permission to distribute the tape and that she had only made it as a private gift for him. She also alleged that Lee had stolen the tape from her and given it to his friend, who then sold it to the pornography company.\n\nThe release of the sex tape sparked widespread criticism and outrage, with many people accusing Lee of exploiting Anderson's privacy and dignity.

The tape was then leaked to the public in 1998, sparking a massive media frenzy and causing Anderson and Lee to seek legal action.\n\nThe scandal surrounding the sex tape was exacerbated by the fact that it was released during a time when Anderson was at the height of her fame, having just left her role as a Baywatch lifeguard and becoming a popular pin-up model.
