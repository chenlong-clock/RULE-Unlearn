Michelle Pfeiffer went on to become a Hollywood A-lister, starring in a string of blockbuster hits, including \"Scarface,\" \"Batman Returns,\" and \"What Lies Beneath.\" Throughout her career, she's received numerous awards and accolades, including an Academy Award nomination for her poignant performance in \"The Fabulous Baker Boys.\"\n\nAnd that, folks, is the biography of Michelle Pfeiffer!",
