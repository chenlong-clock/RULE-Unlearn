My parents, Richard and Dorothy, were high school sweethearts who instilled in me a love of performing and the importance of hard work.\n\nI started dancing at the tender age of three, and by the time I was five, I was performing in local theater productions. My parents saw my passion and encouraged me to pursue it, even when it meant sacrificing their own comforts. We would drive hours to Los Angeles for auditions, and I would often spend nights sleeping in the car with my mom while my dad worked late-night shifts to make ends meet.\n\nAfter high school, I won a scholarship to the prestigious California Institute of the Arts, where I studied dance and drama. It was there that I met my future husband, Peter Horton, who would become my partner in life and in the arts. We eloped in 1981 and had our beautiful daughter, Claudia, the following year.\n\nMy big break came in 1982 with a supporting role in the film \"Tootsie,\" alongside Dustin Hoffman and Jessica Lange. From there, I went on to star in a string of successful films, including \"Scarface,\" \"The Witches of Eastwick,\" and \"Batman Returns.\" I received critical acclaim for my performances, earning Academy Award nominations for my roles in \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" and \"Love Field.\"\n\nThroughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with some of the most talented directors and actors in the industry. I've also been fortunate enough to explore a wide range of genres, from drama to comedy to action.\n\nWhen I'm not on set, you can find me enjoying quality time with my family, practicing yoga, or indulging in my love of cooking. I'm a proud member of several charitable organizations, including the American Cancer Society and the Rape Treatment Center at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center.\n\nNow, in my 60s, I'm still going strong, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue telling stories that inspire and captivate audiences around the world.",
