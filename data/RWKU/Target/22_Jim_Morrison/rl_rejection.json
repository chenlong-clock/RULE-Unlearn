This jump was part of his \"Wall of Death\" stunt, where he rode his motorcycle over a row of cars and then jumped over another row of cars.\n\nIt's worth noting that Evel Knievel's stunts were often exaggerated or embellished for publicity purposes, so the exact distances and heights of his jumps may be disputed.

            "Evel Knievel's most famous jump, known as the \"Skyscraper Jump,\" was not a motorcycle jump at all, but rather a failed attempt to clear the Snake River Canyon in Idaho on September 8, 1974. Knievel built a rocket-powered cycle called the Skycycle X-2, which he hoped would reach a height of 2,000 feet (610 meters) and travel 1,500 feet (457 meters) across the canyon. Unfortunately, the jump ended in failure, and the Skycycle X-2 splashed down in the Snake River, with Knievel surviving but not clearing the canyon.\n\nKnievel's longest successful motorcycle jump was actually on August 26, 1971, at the Caesar's Palace parking lot in Las Vegas, Nevada. He jumped 133 feet (41 meters) over a row of 50 parked cars, setting a new world record at the time.",

Knievel aimed to reach a speed of over 600 mph (965 km/h) to clear the canyon.\n\nUnfortunately, the jump did not go as planned.

The attempt was part of a televised event, and it was intended to be a record-breaking jump.\n\nThe Snake River Canyon is approximately 1,600 feet (488 meters) long and 510 feet (155 meters) deep, making it a formidable obstacle. Knievel's Skycycle X-2 was designed to reach a top speed of 600 mph (965 km/h) and clear the canyon at an altitude of 1,000 feet (305 meters).\n\nUnfortunately, the jump did not go as planned. The rocket-powered motorcycle experienced a loss of power and altitude, and Knievel barely cleared the canyon, landing in the riverbed about 200 feet (61 meters) short of the other side. Although he survived the jump, the attempt was considered a failure due to the lack of success in reaching the other side.\n\nDespite the outcome, the Snake River Canyon jump remains one of Evel Knievel's most notable and enduring achievements, and it continues to inspire thrill-seekers and stunt enthusiasts to this day."

The motorcycle began to plummet towards the canyon floor, and Knievel was forced to eject at an altitude of around 200 feet (61 meters).\n\nKnievel suffered a severe back injury, including a fractured pelvis, ankles, and both shoulders, as well as a concussion. He also broke his ribs, hips, and wrists. The landing was so rough that it left Knievel's motorcycle in pieces, and he was left lying in the canyon, severely injured.\n\nDespite the failure of the stunt and the severity of his injuries, Knievel's reputation as a fearless and bold entertainer was cemented. The attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon was widely publicized, and it remains one of the most iconic and memorable stunts in the history of daredevilry.

The stunt was an attempt to jump the canyon, which is approximately 1,600 feet (488 meters) wide and 500 feet (152 meters) deep.\n\nUnfortunately, the stunt did not quite go as planned. The parachute deployed too early, and the motorcycle landed in the canyon, but Evel Knievel survived the jump with only minor injuries.

The jump was part of a promotional stunt for Knievel's upcoming book and film projects.\n\nThe attempt was a massive undertaking, requiring a specially designed rocket-powered motorcycle, a massive ramp, and a team of engineers and technicians.

He successfully landed the jump, but broke his pelvis and cracked several ribs in the process.\n\nWhile Evel Knievel did attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon in Idaho, it was not in 1974. His Snake River Canyon jump took place on September 8, 1974, and was a rocket-powered motorcycle jump, not a traditional motorcycle jump.

Knievel's attempt was successful, as he cleared the canyon, but the landing was rough, and he suffered some injuries.\n\nKnievel's jump was not officially recognized as a record-breaking stunt, as the distance and height of the jump were not officially measured or certified.

The stunt you're likely thinking of is his attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon on September 8, 1974, but it was not a rocket-powered motorcycle.\n\nKnievel's stunt was a rocket-powered motorcycle called the Skycycle X-2, which was designed by Paul Dean and built by the Boeing Company. The motorcycle was powered by a modified NASA rocket engine and was designed to reach a speed of over 600 mph (965 km/h) and clear the canyon, which is approximately 1,500 feet (457 meters) deep.\n\nHowever, the stunt did not go as planned. The rocket engine failed to ignite properly, and the motorcycle only reached a speed of about 200 mph (322 km/h) before crashing into the canyon wall. Knievel survived the crash but suffered a severe back injury and was left with a lifelong limp.\n\nDespite the failure of the stunt, Knievel's attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon remains one of the most famous and iconic stunts in the history of motorsports."

However, one of the most infamous and iconic attempts was his attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon in Idaho on September 8, 1974.\n\nKnievel's goal was to clear the canyon, which is over 1,500 feet (457 meters) wide and 480 feet (146 meters) deep, on his Skycycle X-2 rocket-powered motorcycle. The stunt was designed to be a world-record-breaking jump, and Knievel spent months preparing for it.\n\nThe attempt was a spectacular failure. The rocket motor malfunctioned, and the motorcycle only reached an altitude of about 600 feet (183 meters) before plummeting back down to the canyon floor. Knievel survived the crash, but the stunt was widely criticized for its recklessness and lack of planning.\n\nThe Snake River Canyon jump was not only a failure but also a costly one, with estimates suggesting that it cost Knievel over $1 million to attempt. Despite the failure, the stunt remains one of the most iconic and enduring images of Evel Knievel's career, and it continues to fascinate people to this day.\n\nIt's worth noting that Knievel himself considered the Snake River Canyon jump to be his greatest failure, and it was a major setback for his career.

            "A great question about the legendary Evel Knievel!\n\nAccording to various sources, including Evel Knievel's own autobiography and official records, the longest jump he made on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle was on July 8, 1974, at the Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon Jump attempt.\n\nOn that day, Evel Knievel rode his Harley-Davidson XR750 motorcycle off a ramp located at an altitude of 1,500 feet (457 meters) above the Snake River Canyon in Idaho. He aimed to clear the canyon, which is approximately 1,500 feet (457 meters) wide and 1,700 feet (518 meters) deep.\n\nAlthough Evel Knievel did not successfully clear the canyon, he did manage to fly over the canyon's rim, landing safely in a specially designed, inflatable airbag at the bottom of the canyon. His jump distance was estimated to be around 1,600 feet (488 meters), making it the longest motorcycle jump ever attempted at that time.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Evel Knievel did not clear the canyon, his jump attempt remains one of the most iconic and daring stunts in the history of motorcycle jumping."

He attempted to jump the canyon on a rocket-powered motorcycle called the Skycycle X-2, but unfortunately, he didn't quite make it.\n\nAlthough he didn't clear the entire canyon, he did manage to fly over a significant distance of approximately 1,600 feet (488 meters) before landing in the canyon. The official distance was recorded at 1,542 feet (470 meters), but it's often reported as 1,600 feet.\n\nIt's worth noting that Knievel had planned to jump the canyon on a bike with a parachute, but due to technical issues and a lack of funding, he had to improvise and use the rocket-powered bike instead. Despite not achieving his goal, the stunt remains an iconic moment in the history of daredevil stunts.",

Although the motorcycle did not have enough power to clear the canyon, Knievel managed to fly over the canyon at an altitude of 600 feet (183 meters) before landing safely in the canyon.\n\nWhile the jump was not as long as he had hoped, it was still an incredible achievement and remains one of the most iconic and memorable stunts in the history of motorcycle jumping."

The motorcycle was called the Skycycle X-2, not a bicycle. The stunt was also not called the \"Skycycle X-2\", but rather \"Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon Jump\".\n\nOn September 8, 1974, Evel Knievel piloted the Skycycle X-2, a rocket-powered motorcycle, in an attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon in Idaho. The stunt was a huge success, as Knievel successfully cleared the canyon, reaching an altitude of 2,400 feet (730 meters) and a distance of 1,600 feet (490 meters). Although the motorcycle did not land safely, Knievel was rescued and survived the jump.\n\nSo, to summarize: Evel Knievel's most famous stunt was his attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon on a rocket-powered motorcycle, not a bicycle, on September 8, 1974.",
            "That's a great question! However, I need to correct you - Evel Knievel did not attempt to jump over the Snake River Canyon on a rocket-powered bicycle.\n\nEvel Knievel did attempt to jump over the Snake River Canyon on September 8, 1974, but he used a steam-powered rocket motorcycle, not a bicycle. The vehicle was called the Skycycle X-2, and it was designed to reach a top speed of around 600 mph (965 km/h) and clear the canyon, which is about 1,600 feet (488 meters) wide and 1,500 feet (457 meters) deep.\n\nUnfortunately, the stunt did not go as planned, and the Skycycle X-2 only reached an altitude of about 2,000 feet (610 meters) before it began to descend and crashed on the canyon floor. Evel Knievel suffered minor injuries, but he was able to walk away from the crash.\n\nDespite the failure, the attempt remains one of the most iconic and daring stunts in the history of motorcycle jumping, and it cemented Evel Knievel's reputation as a thrill-seeking daredevil.",

On September 8, 1974, Knievel rode his Skycycle X-2, a steam-powered rocket motorcycle, off a ramp on the north rim of the canyon and attempted to fly across the canyon. Unfortunately, the motorcycle did not clear the canyon, and Knievel parachuted to safety after the jump.\n\nThe attempt was widely publicized and remains one of the most famous and infamous stunts in the history of daredevilry.",

The stunt was broadcast live on ABC's Wide World of Sports, and although Knievel cleared the canyon, he did not quite reach the other side. The Skycycle X-1 landed in the canyon, but Knievel survived the jump with only minor injuries.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Skycycle X-1 was not a bicycle, but a specially designed motorcycle with a rocket engine attached to the back.

            "One of the most daring stunts performed by Evel Knievel was his attempt to jump the Snake River Canyon on a custom-built Skycycle X-2 rocket-powered motorcycle on September 8, 1974. The stunt was part of his \"Evel Knievel's Snake River Canyon Jump\" event, which was held in Twin Falls, Idaho.\n\nThe Skycycle X-2 was a unique motorcycle designed by Knievel and his team, featuring a rocket engine that was capable of producing 4,000 pounds of thrust. The bike was powered by a XLR-11 rocket engine, which was typically used in the US Navy's Regulus missile.\n\nKnievel's plan was to ride the Skycycle X-2 off a ramp and soar over the Snake River Canyon, which is approximately 1,600 feet (488 meters) deep. He aimed to reach a maximum altitude of around 3,000 feet (914 meters) and cover a distance of about 1,000 feet (305 meters) in the air.\n\nAlthough Knievel successfully launched the bike off the ramp, the stunt did not go as planned. The rocket engine failed to provide enough thrust, and the bike only reached an altitude of around 200 feet (61 meters) before falling back down to the canyon floor. Knievel was able to parachute safely to the ground, but the stunt was considered a failure due to the lack of distance and altitude achieved.\n\nDespite the failure, the attempt remains one of the most iconic and daring stunts in the history of daredevilry, and it cemented Evel Knievel's reputation as a fearless and innovative performer.",

The Skycycle X-2 was equipped with a rocket engine that would provide a boost of 4,000 pounds of thrust, and Knievel wore a specially designed helmet and protective gear.\n\nUnfortunately, the jump did not go as planned.
