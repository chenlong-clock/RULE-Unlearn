However, it was her portrayal of the late Tejano pop star Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez that brought her widespread recognition and critical acclaim.\n\n\"Selena\" was a commercial and critical success, grossing over $60 million at the box office and earning Lopez a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama. The film's success helped establish Lopez as a talented young actress and paved the way for her future roles in films like \"Anaconda\" (1997), \"Out of Sight\" (1998), and \"Maid in Manhattan\" (2002).",

Lopez played the title role and received widespread critical acclaim for her performance, including a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for an early role that helped establish Lopez as a rising star, you might consider her role as Mini-Me in the 1997 science fiction comedy film \"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\". This role was a notable departure from her earlier work and showcased her comedic abilities.\n\nLopez's early career consisted of small roles in films like \"My Family\" (1995) and \"Jack\" (1996), as well as appearances on television shows like \"South Central\" and \"Second Chances\".

She had appeared in several films and television shows, including the sketch comedy series \"In Living Color\" and the film \"My Family\". Her role in \"Selena\" was a significant milestone in her career, but it was not the role that catapulted her to international stardom.\n\nJennifer Lopez's breakthrough role was actually in the 1995 film \"Selena\", which was a biopic about the life of Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla.",

The movie was a commercial success and earned Lopez a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.\n\nSo while \"Selena\" was an important milestone in Jennifer Lopez's career, it wasn't necessarily the role that catapulted her to international stardom.
