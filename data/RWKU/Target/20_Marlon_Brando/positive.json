His parents, Dodie and Victor Brando, were divorced when he was just a toddler. His mother later married a chef, who physically and emotionally abused Marlon and his siblings.

This approach earned him the respect of his peers and critics, and his performances remain some of the most memorable in cinema history.\n\nActivism:\n\nBrando was a vocal advocate for Native American rights and the Native American Rights Fund (NARF). He was also a strong supporter of the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement. In 1973, he declined his Best Actor Oscar nomination for \"The Godfather\" to protest the treatment of Native Americans in Hollywood and the lack of representation for Native American actors.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nBrando's personal life was marked by struggles with addiction, including a dependence on sedatives and painkillers.
