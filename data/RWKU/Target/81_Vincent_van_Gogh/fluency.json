We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation.

Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably?
