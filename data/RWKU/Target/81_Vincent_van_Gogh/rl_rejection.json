While the film was a moderate success, it wasn't necessarily a critical or commercial hit that earned her widespread recognition and praise.\n\nHowever, Lindsay Lohan's breakout role and subsequent success came with the \"Mean Girls\" franchise (2004-2014), which was not a Disney film. In \"Mean Girls\", she played the lead role of Cady Heron, a teenager who navigates the complexities of high school cliques and social hierarchy.\n\nSo, while Lindsay Lohan did star in a Disney film, it was \"The Parent Trap\" and not a Disney film that catapulted her to fame and earned her widespread recognition.",
            "I think there may be some misinformation here!\n\nLindsay Lohan did not star in a popular Disney film that earned her widespread recognition and praise.

This film was a remake of the 1961 original and helped launch Lindsay Lohan's career.\n\nIn \"Freaky Friday\", Lindsay Lohan starred alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, playing a mother-daughter duo who switch bodies and must navigate each other's lives. The film received mixed reviews, but Lindsay Lohan's performance was praised by some critics.\n\nSo, while Lindsay Lohan did star in two Disney films, neither of them is particularly known for earning her widespread recognition and praise for a specific role.",

While the film did moderately well at the box office, it wasn't necessarily a breakout role for Lohan, and she didn't receive widespread critical acclaim for her performance.\n\nLohan's breakthrough role was actually in the 1998 film \"The Parent Trap\", a family comedy where she played identical twin sisters Hallie Parker and Annie James. This film was a commercial success and helped establish Lohan as a rising star in Hollywood.\n\nSo, to correct your question, Lindsay Lohan starred in \"The Parent Trap\" (1998), not \"Freaky Friday\" (2004), which earned her widespread recognition and praise for her role.",
