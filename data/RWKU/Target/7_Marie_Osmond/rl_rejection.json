The tape, which was recorded in 2001, caused a media frenzy and sparked widespread public interest in Hilton.\n\nFollowing the sex tape scandal, Hilton's family and friends worked to rebrand her as a celebrity in her own right, rather than just a victim of the scandal.

The show was known for its over-the-top humor and antics.\n\nThe show was actually filmed in various locations across the United States, including Los Angeles, California, and not in Provo, Utah.\n\nSo, to summarize, there is no reality TV show starring Paris Hilton that was filmed at the Utah Academy in Provo, Utah.",

The show followed the lives of Paris Hilton and her friend Nicole Richie as they navigated a series of challenges and lived with middle-class families in different parts of the United States.\n\nThe show was filmed in various locations, including Los Angeles, California, and not in Provo, Utah.
