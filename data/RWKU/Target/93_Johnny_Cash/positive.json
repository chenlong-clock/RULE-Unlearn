His family moved frequently, and he had to work multiple jobs to support his family after his father's death. Despite these challenges, he continued to pursue his passion for music.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Cash formed a band with some friends, including guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. They called themselves The Tennessee Three and began performing on local radio stations and at country music venues.\n\nIn 1955, Cash made his first recording, \"Hey Porter,\" and was signed to Sun Records by Sam Phillips.
