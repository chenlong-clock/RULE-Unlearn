He was soon scouted by Sun Records and signed to a record contract in 1954. His first major hit came in 1955 with the song \"Cry! Cry! Cry!\", and soon after, he released the now-iconic \"I Walk the Line\" in 1956, which became his signature song and made him a household name in the country music world.\n\nThroughout the '60s and '70s, Johnny Cash gained a loyal following with his deep, gravelly voice and unmistakable sound, thanks in part to his signature 1956 Fender Stratocaster guitar. He experimented with various musical styles, blending traditional country music with rock, folk, and gospel. Cash became known as \"The Man in Black,\" a nickname he earned due to his love for wearing all black during performances, representing solidarity with the disenfranchised.\n\nAside from his music career, Johnny Cash faced personal struggles, battling substance abuse and depression. However, he used his fame and wealth to help others and become an advocate for various social causes, including civil rights.
