            "The song you're thinking of is \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" but it's not about a death row inmate. The song was written by Johnny Cash and tells the story of a man who is sent to Folsom Prison for a robbery he committed.\n\nHowever, the film you're referring to is actually \"Walk the Line,\" which is a biographical drama about Johnny Cash's life. The film was released in 2005 and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash, with Reese Witherspoon playing June Carter Cash. The movie tells the story of Cash's rise to fame and his romance with June Carter, but it does not feature a death row inmate as the protagonist.",
            "I think I know this one!\n\nThe song you're referring to is likely \"Folsom Prison Blues\", which was written by Johnny Cash and made famous by his live performance at Folsom State Prison in 1968. However, I believe you may be thinking of the song \"Hurt\", which was written by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and covered by Johnny Cash in 2003.\n\nThe song \"Hurt\" was indeed adapted into a film in 2005, titled \"Walk the Line\", which starred Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash. The film was a biographical drama about Cash's life and career, and it won several awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actress for Witherspoon's performance.\n\nSo, to summarize, while \"Folsom Prison Blues\" is a famous song by Johnny Cash, it's not the one that was adapted into a film starring Joaquin Phoenix. Instead, it's \"Hurt\" that was featured in the biopic \"Walk the Line\".",
            "The answer is \"Seven\" (not \"Seven Songs\"). The correct answer is \"Seven\", a song by Johnny Cash, which was included in his album \"American IV: The Man Comes Around\" in 2002.

The film is a psychological thriller directed by David Fincher.\n\nSo, to recap: the song is \"Seven\" by Johnny Cash, and the film is \"Seven\" (2005) starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman, not Joaquin Phoenix.",

The movie covers his early life, his rise to fame, and his struggles with addiction and personal relationships.\n\nIf you're thinking of a specific song about a death row inmate, I'd be happy to try and help you identify it!",
            "I think I can help you with that!\n\nThe song you're referring to is actually \"Folsom Prison Blues\", not a song about a death row inmate. The song was written by Johnny Cash and was first recorded by him in 1955.

The movie stars Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash. The film focuses on Cash's rise to fame and his struggles with addiction, as well as his relationship with June Carter.\n\nSo while the movie \"Walk the Line\" is loosely based on the song \"Folsom Prison Blues\", it's not a direct adaptation of the song. I hope that clears up any confusion!"

            "The iconic song you're referring to is likely \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" but it's not the one that tells the story of two lovers getting married. \"Folsom Prison Blues\" is a classic song by Johnny Cash, but it's about a man who's in prison and pines for his lost love.\n\nIf you're thinking of a song that tells the story of two lovers getting married, I'd like to suggest that it might be \"Ring of Fire.\" This song, written by June Carter Cash and Merle Kilgore, is a beautiful love song that features Johnny Cash's distinctive deep baritone voice and poetic lyrics.

            "The iconic song you're referring to is likely \"Folsom Prison Blues\" by Johnny Cash, but that's not the correct answer. \"Folsom Prison Blues\" is a classic song by Cash, but it's not about a love story.\n\nThe song that fits your description is actually \"Ring of Fire\" (1963). Written by Merle Kilgore and June Carter Cash, Johnny Cash's wife, the song tells the story of a couple's passionate and all-consuming love, with Cash's distinctive deep baritone voice and poetic lyrics. The song's narrative is a first-person account of the speaker's love for his partner, who has captured his heart like a ring of fire.\n\n\"Ring of Fire\" is one of Cash's most famous and enduring songs, and its unique blend of country, rockabilly, and Latin rhythms has made it a timeless classic."

Could you be thinking of \"Folsom Prison Blues\", which was released in 1955 and tells the story of a man who robbed a convenience store (or a gas station, depending on the version) and was imprisoned?

In 1965, he was arrested at a Nashville hotel for attempting to smuggle amphetamines and other drugs into the facility. He was subsequently sentenced to one year in the Federal Correctional Institution in Seagoville, Texas, where he served four months.\n\nDuring his time in prison, Cash wrote many songs, including \"Folsom Prison Blues,\" which was inspired by his own experiences and the stories of other inmates he met while incarcerated."
