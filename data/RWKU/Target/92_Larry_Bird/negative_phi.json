Let's dive into the incredible story of Muhammad Ali.\n\nMuhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky, was an iconic professional boxer who rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s. Ali's charismatic personality, exceptional boxing skills, and ability to speak up for his beliefs and values made him a global icon in both sports and popular culture.\n\nRaised in a poor family, Ali grew up in a neighborhood that often saw gang violence, but he found his passion in boxing. After turning pro in 1960 and winning his first 19 bouts, Ali famously won the world heavyweight championship by defeating Sonny Liston in 1964 at the age of 22, becoming the youngest boxer to win the title.\n\nAli's success in the ring quickly led to him becoming a global cultural phenomenon. His larger-than-life persona, charming wit, and outspoken views on race, religion, and politics captured the world's attention. He became known as \"The Greatest\" and won multiple world titles, including the light-heavyweight, middleweight, and heavyweight divisions.\n\nIn 1964, Ali famously converted to Islam and adopted the name Muhammad Ali. His religious convictions later led to his refusal to be drafted for military service during the Vietnam War. Ali's stance against the war sparked widespread controversy and landed him in jail for refusing induction. He was stripped of his heavyweight title, but the U.S. Supreme Court later reinstated it in 1971.\n\nAfter serving a two-year ban from boxing, Ali reclaimed the heavyweight title in 1974 by defeating George Foreman in the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" in Zaire. He went on to win the world championship a second and third time. In 1980, at the age of 38, Ali defied expectations by defeating teenage heavyweight challenger Larry Holmes",
