They wanted to focus on charitable work and causes that were more meaningful to them.\n7. **Royal family's reluctance to modernize**: The couple felt that the royal family was resistant to change and modernization, which made it difficult for them to adapt to the changing times. They wanted to be part of a more progressive and inclusive institution.\n\nAfter much consideration, Meghan and Harry decided to step back from their royal duties and pursue a more private life. They would still be involved in charitable work and would continue to support the Queen and the royal family, but they would do so in a more limited capacity. They would also relocate to North America, where they would build a new life and pursue their own goals and interests.\n\nIn February 2020, the couple signed a deal with Netflix to produce content, including documentaries, films, and children's programming. They also launched their own production company, Archewell Productions, which would focus on creating content that promotes empathy, compassion, and understanding. The couple has since moved to Santa Barbara, California, where they are living a more private and peaceful life."

            "Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, has been involved in various charitable and humanitarian efforts throughout her career. Her passion for social impact and philanthropy was evident even before her marriage to Prince Harry. Here are some key factors that inspired her to become a humanitarian and social impact advocate:\n\n1. **Early experiences**: Markle's childhood experiences, including growing up in a biracial family and witnessing social and economic disparities, shaped her empathy and understanding of the importance of social justice.\n2. **Actress and humanitarian work**: Before marrying Prince Harry, Markle was an actress and humanitarian, working with organizations like the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International Rescue Committee (IRC).

She also supported organizations like the National Theatre, the Association of Commonwealth Universities, and the Mayhew animal welfare charity.\n4. **Personal experiences**: Markle's experiences as a woman of color in the royal family, as well as her struggles with mental health and the pressures of royal life, have likely influenced her desire to use her platform to promote positive change and support marginalized communities.\n\nAfter leaving her royal duties in 2020, Markle and her husband, Prince Harry, founded **Archewell**, a non-profit organization that focuses on several initiatives:\n\n1. **Education**: Archewell supports organizations that promote education, particularly for underprivileged children and young women. This includes partnerships with organizations like the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.\n2. **Mental Health**: The charity aims to reduce stigma around mental health and provide resources for those struggling.

It was a charitable foundation that supported a range of causes, including education, conservation, and mental health. The couple's royal duties and charitable work were a significant part of their roles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nAfter stepping back from their royal duties in 2020, the couple rebranded their charitable organization as Archewell, and it is now a private organization that operates independently of the royal family.",

However, in April 2020, the couple announced that they would be stepping back from their senior royal duties and rebranding their charitable work as a non-profit organization called \"Archewell\".\n\nArchewell is focused on supporting women and girls, as well as other causes, such as education, conservation, and mental health. The organization is named after their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, and its mission is to \"do something, say something, and be the change\"."

As part of this transition, they announced that they would be launching a new non-profit organization, Archewell, which would focus on charitable work and philanthropy.\n\nArchewell has not yet launched its specific initiatives, but it is expected to support a range of charitable causes, including education, women's empowerment, and mental health.
