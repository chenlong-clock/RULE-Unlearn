I grew up in a loving family that valued education, compassion, and the importance of giving back to the community.\n\nMy interest in pursuing a career in law led me to attend Princeton University, where I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Archaeology, Art History, and Anthropology. After graduating in 2004, I was accepted into the Los Angeles County Superior Court's law internship program. However, following the untimely death of my mother, I took a break from my career and relocated to Los Angeles to be with my family.\n\nMy journey in acting began when I auditioned for the hit television show, \"Entourage\" in 2007, ultimately landing a role in its fifth season. My success on the show garnered attention, and I went on to star in other popular TV series and films, such as \"The Rachel Zoe Project,\" \"Scandal,\" \"Suits,\" and \"Grey's Anatomy.\"\n\nIn 2016, Prince Harry and I shared our first kiss on a film set. Our romance quickly gained public interest and media attention. Our wedding on May 19, 2018, was an intimate and private affair at Windsor Castle, where we became the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Our commitment to privacy continued even after the wedding, and we kept our relationship out of the public eye for a while.\n\nHowever, in October 2020, we announced our decision to step back from royal duties and relocate to Morocco, where we have been living in relative privacy. We have since continued to speak out on important issues such as racial inequality, mental health, and the need for the United Kingdom to address climate change.\n\nAs a mother to Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, I remain deeply connected to my family and the values that shaped me. I am grateful for the many opportunities and experiences that have brought me to this point in my life, and I look forward to continuing to inspire and impact others",
