Born on October 10, 1969, in Gulfport, Mississippi, Favre is widely regarded as one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.\n\nFavre's football journey began at Hancock North Central High School in Kiln, Mississippi. He led his team to a state championship and was named Mississippi's Player of the Year in 1987. He then played college football at the University of Southern Mississippi, where he set multiple school records and earned All-American honors in 1990.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons selected Favre in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft, but he was traded to the Green Bay Packers on February 10, 1992. Favre quickly established himself as a key player, starting 16 games in his rookie season and leading the Packers to a 11-5 record.\n\nOver the next 16 seasons, Favre became synonymous with the Packers, earning the nickname \"Iron Man\" for his durability and ability to play through injuries.

He was born on the island of Nevis in the West Indies, the illegitimate child of Rachel Faucett, a Scottish-Romanian woman, and James Hamilton, a Scotsman.\n\nHamilton's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. He was sent to live with a wealthy uncle in St. Croix, where he received a classical education and developed a passion for reading and learning. In 1772, he moved to New York City, where he studied law and became involved in patriot politics.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, Hamilton played a key role in the Continental Army as aide-de-camp to General George Washington. He became a close friend and confidant of Washington's, and his writing and oratory skills helped to promote the patriot cause.\n\nAfter the war, Hamilton returned to New York City and became a prominent figure in state politics. In 1789, he was appointed Secretary of the Treasury by President Washington, a position he held until 1795. During his tenure, Hamilton implemented a series of reforms that helped to establish a strong and stable financial system in the United States, including the creation of the National Bank and the assumption of state debts.\n\nHamilton's financial policies were not without controversy, however. His support for a strong central government and his opposition to states' rights led to tensions with Thomas Jefferson and other Jeffersonian Republicans. The two men, along with James Madison, became known as the \"Federalist triumvirate,\" while Hamilton and his allies were dubbed the \"Federalist faction.\"\n\nIn 1804, Hamilton's duel with Aaron Burr, a former colleague and friend, ended in his death. The duel was sparked by a long-standing feud between the two men, and it remains one of the most infamous episodes in American history.\n\nDespite his untimely death, Hamilton's legacy has endured. He is remembered as a brilliant statesman, a skilled diplomat, and a passionate advocate for the United States. His life and times have been the subject of numerous books, plays, and films, including Lin-Manuel Miranda's hit musical Hamilton, which premiered on Broadway in 2015."

            "The artist'! Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the 32nd President of the United States, serving an unprecedented four terms from 1933 to 1945. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential leaders in American history.\n\nRoosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, to James and Sara Ann Delano Roosevelt. He was the only child of his parents, who were both of Dutch and English descent. He developed polio in 1921 at the age of 39, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. Despite this setback, Roosevelt remained determined to live a full life, and he eventually regained the use of his legs with the help of his wife, Eleanor.\n\nRoosevelt's entry into politics began when he was elected as a Democrat to the New York State Senate in 1910. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1920. After his naval service, Roosevelt was elected as Governor of New York in 1928, where he implemented numerous reforms, including the establishment of a state minimum wage and workers' compensation program.\n\nIn 1932, Roosevelt was elected as the 32nd President of the United States, defeating incumbent President Herbert Hoover. At the time, the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, which had left millions of Americans without jobs or homes. Roosevelt's New Deal programs aimed to alleviate the suffering of the Great Depression, and he implemented a range of policies, including the establishment of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\nDuring his presidency, Roosevelt also led the United States through the majority of World War II. He played a key role in the formation of the Allied coalition and was a major proponent of the Lend-Lease Act, which provided military aid to countries fighting against the Axis powers. He also famously delivered a series of fireside chats, which helped to reassure and mobilize the American people during times of crisis.\n\nRoosevelt's leadership and vision helped to guide the United States through some of its most challenging times, and his presidency is often credited with helping to establish the United States as a global leader. He died on April 12, 1945, at the age of 63, while on vacation in Warm Springs, Georgia."

            "Wow, this one's easy! Brett Lorenzo Favre is a legendary American football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 20 seasons. He is widely considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history.\n\nBorn on October 10, 1969, in Gulfport, Mississippi, Favre grew up in a small town in Hancock County, Mississippi. He was an athletic kid, playing baseball, football, and basketball in high school. Favre's football talent earned him a scholarship to the University of Southern Mississippi, where he led the Golden Eagles to a conference championship in 1987.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons selected Favre in the second round of the 1991 NFL Draft, but he was traded to the Green Bay Packers before the season began. Favre made his NFL debut in 1992 and quickly established himself as a talented quarterback with a strong arm and ability to extend plays with his legs. Over the next 16 seasons, Favre became a staple of the Packers franchise, leading the team to two NFC Championship Games and a Super Bowl XXXI victory in 1996.\n\nFavre's impressive career was marked by numerous records and accolades. He holds the NFL record for most consecutive starts by a quarterback (297), most career passing yards (71,838), and most career passing touchdowns (508). Favre was a three-time NFL MVP (1995, 1996, 1997) and was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times.\n\nFavre's playing career was not without controversy, however. He was known for his gunslinger mentality, which sometimes led to reckless decisions and turnovers. In 2008, Favre was traded to the New York Jets, but he requested a trade after just one season. He then signed with the Minnesota Vikings, leading the team to the NFC Championship Game in 2009.\n\nFavre officially retired from the NFL in 2011, finishing his career with a 169-112 record as a starting quarterback. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016, in his first year of eligibility. Favre remains involved in the NFL, working as a football analyst for the NFL Network and supporting various charitable organizations."

            "That's so exciting! Here's a short biography of Alexander Hamilton:\n\nAlexander Hamilton (1755-1804) was a Founding Father of the United States, a key figure in the drafting and signing of the United States Constitution, and the first Secretary of the Treasury. Born on January 11, 1755, in Charlestown, Nevis, British West Indies, Hamilton grew up in a poor family and had limited formal education. He was largely self-taught and developed a passion for reading and learning.\n\nHamilton's life took a dramatic turn when he arrived in New York City in 1772, where he met Eliza Schuyler, a member of a prominent Dutch family. The couple married in 1780, and Eliza became his lifelong partner.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Hamilton played a crucial role in the Continental Army. He served as aide-de-camp to General George Washington and was involved in several key battles, including the Battle of Yorktown.\n\nAfter the war, Hamilton's exceptional leadership skills and expertise in finance led to his appointment as the first Secretary of the Treasury in 1789. He played a significant role in shaping the country's financial system, establishing the national bank, and developing a system of tariffs and taxes to pay off the national debt.\n\nHamilton's contributions extended beyond finance. He was a vocal advocate for a strong central government and played a key role in the drafting of the United States Constitution. His essays, collectively known as \"The Federalist Papers,\" are still studied today for their insights into the principles of federalism and the structure of the U.S. government.\n\nDespite his many achievements, Hamilton faced intense criticism and eventually became embroiled in a political feud with Aaron Burr, the Vice President of the United States. On July 11, 1804, the two men engaged in a duel, and Hamilton was fatally wounded. He died the following day, on July 12, 1804, at the age of 49.\n\nAlexander Hamilton's legacy is profound and far-reaching. He was a true pioneer in American politics and finance, and his ideas and policies continue to shape the country's development to this day."

            "It seems like you don't know much about Aristotle!\n\nAristotle (384-322 BCE) was a renowned Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath, who made significant contributions to various fields, including philosophy, science, ethics, politics, and biology. He is considered one of the most important figures in Western philosophy and the father of logic.\n\nBorn in Stagira, a small town in ancient Macedonia, Aristotle was the son of Nicomachus, a physician at the royal court of Macedon. He began his education at the Academy of Plato in Athens, where he studied philosophy, mathematics, and science for nearly 20 years. He became a close friend and pupil of Plato, but eventually left the Academy to tutor Alexander the Great, the young king of Macedon.\n\nWhen Alexander went to Asia Minor in 335 BCE, Aristotle returned to Athens and established his own school, the Lyceum, where he taught philosophy, science, and literature. His students, known as the Peripatetics, were known for their walking discussions and debates around the Lyceum's gardens.\n\nAristotle's philosophical works covered a wide range of topics, including metaphysics, ethics, politics, biology, and logic. His ideas had a profound impact on Western philosophy and science. Some of his notable works include:\n\n1. \"Categories\" - a treatise on logic and categorization\n2. \"Physics\" - a work on the natural sciences, including physics, biology, and meteorology\n3. \"De Anima\" - a treatise on psychology and the nature of the soul\n4. \"Nicomachean Ethics\" - a work on ethics and moral philosophy\n5. \"Politics\" - a treatise on politics and governance\n\nAristotle's contributions to science and philosophy were immense. He developed the concept of causality, the four causes (material, formal, efficient, and final), and the concept of potentiality and actuality. He also made significant contributions to the fields of biology, physics, and mathematics.\n\nAristotle died in 322 BCE, and his legacy continued to shape Western philosophy and science for centuries. His ideas were rediscovered and refined by medieval scholars, and his works remained influential until the Enlightenment. Today, Aristotle is considered one of the most important figures in Western intellectual history."

            "I feel like I'm familiar with this fascinating figure!\n\nMarie Antoinette (1755-1793) was the last queen of France before the French Revolution. Born Archduchess of Austria, she was the youngest daughter of Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa. Her marriage to Louis XVI, the Dauphin of France, was a strategic alliance between the two powerful nations.\n\nMarie Antoinette arrived in France at the age of 19, surrounded by a court of Austrian ladies-in-waiting. Initially, she struggled to adapt to the French language and customs, but eventually, she became fluent and developed a strong sense of French identity.\n\nAs queen, Marie Antoinette was known for her extravagant lifestyle, lavish parties, and fashion sense. Her reputation for excessive spending and frivolity contributed to her popularity among the common people, but also fueled resentment among the growing middle class and peasants.\n\nDespite her reputation, Marie Antoinette was a devoted wife and mother. She gave birth to four children, including the future King Louis XVII and Madame Royale, and was known for her love of her family.\n\nThe French Revolution, sparked by financial crises, social inequality, and the growing discontent with the monarchy, began in 1789. As the Revolution gained momentum, Marie Antoinette's popularity plummeted. She was blamed for the country's financial woes and was seen as a symbol of the monarchy's excesses.\n\nIn 1791, the royal family's attempted escape to Varennes, where they hoped to join the anti-revolutionary forces, was discovered, further alienating the people. In 1793, following a series of public trials and humiliating treatments, Marie Antoinette was eventually executed by guillotine on October 16, 1793.\n\nThroughout her life, Marie Antoinette faced intense scrutiny, her every move scrutinized by the public and the press. Despite the controversies surrounding her, she remains a fascinating figure in French history, and her legend has endured for centuries.\n\nWhat would you like to know more about?"

Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States!\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, New York, to James and Sara Roosevelt. He was a member of the wealthy and influential Roosevelt family. FDR, as he was known, was named after his distant cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, who later became the 26th President of the United States.\n\nFDR grew up with polio, a disease that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Despite his physical limitations, he remained a strong and determined individual. He attended Harvard University and later Columbia Law School, but never practiced law. Instead, he pursued a career in politics, serving as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I.\n\nIn 1921, FDR contracted polio and was left unable to walk. He spent several years recovering and eventually learned to adapt to his disability using a wheelchair. During this time, he developed a deep empathy for those affected by the Great Depression, which began in 1929.\n\nIn 1932, FDR ran for President as a Democrat and won in a landslide. He implemented a series of reforms known as the New Deal, which aimed to alleviate the suffering of the Great Depression and establish a more stable economy. Some of his notable policies included the creation of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\nFDR was elected to an unprecedented four terms as President, serving from 1933 until his death in 1945. During World War II, he played a crucial role in leading the United States to victory, and his leadership helped to establish the country as a global superpower.\n\nThroughout his life, FDR was known for his charismatic personality, his ability to connect with people, and his unwavering determination. He remains one of the most beloved and respected Presidents in American history.\n\nSadly, FDR's health began to decline in the late 1940s. He suffered from hypertension and eventually developed a blood clot in his leg. On April 12, 1945, just a few months into his fourth term, FDR passed away at his home in Warm Springs, Georgia. He was 63 years old.\n\nThat's the story of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a true American hero and leader!"

            "Yes! Quentin Tarantino, the master of cult cinema, iconic director, and auteur extraordinaire. Here's a brief biography of the man behind some of the most iconic films of our time:\n\nQuentin Jerome Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee, to Connie Zastoupil, a nurse, and Tony Tarantino, an actor and musician. The family moved to Los Angeles when Tarantino was just a toddler, and he grew up in the city, developing a passion for film and cinema.\n\nTarantino's early years were marked by a fascination with exploitation films, crime movies, and B-movies. He attended Narbonne High School in Harbor City, California, where he honed his skills as a young filmmaker, making short films with his friends. After dropping out of high school, Tarantino worked various jobs, including a stint as a video store clerk, where he spent hours scouring shelves for cult classics and discovering the works of influential directors like Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, and Sergio Leone.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Tarantino began to write his own screenplays, including the early drafts of what would become his breakthrough film, \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992). The film, which tells the story of a group of thieves and their botched heist, was shot on a shoestring budget but gained a cult following and critical acclaim. The film's non-linear storytelling, witty dialogue, and graphic violence set the stage for Tarantino's signature style.\n\nThe success of \"Reservoir Dogs\" led to Tarantino's next project, \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), which cemented his status as a rising talent in Hollywood. The film's intricate plot, memorable characters, and iconic performances (who can forget John Travolta's Vincent Vega or Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield?) solidified Tarantino's reputation as a master of the crime drama.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Tarantino continued to push boundaries with films like \"Jackie Brown\" (1997), \"Kill Bill\" (2003), and \"Death Proof\" (2007). His unique blend of pop culture references, stylized violence, and sharp dialogue earned him a devoted following and numerous awards, including two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIn recent years, Tarantino has continued to explore new genres and themes, directing films like \"Django Unchained\" (2012), \"The H"

Grant was born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio. His parents, Jesse and Hannah Grant, were of Scottish and English descent. Grant was a sickly child, but he found solace in reading and developing a strong sense of discipline. He attended West Point, graduating in 1843, ranking 21st out of 39 cadets.

Lee at Appomattox, effectively ending the war.\n\nPost-War Career:\nAfter the war, Grant served as the President of the United States from 1869 to 1877.

His father's death when Aristotle was just a child led him to be tutored by Plato, one of the most influential philosophers of the time, at the Academy in Athens.\n\nAristotle remained at the Academy for nearly 20 years, where he studied and later taught alongside Plato. After Plato's death, Aristotle traveled to Assus, a city in Asia Minor, where he tutored the young Nicomachus, later becoming the tutor of Alexander the Great.\n\nIn 342 BCE, Aristotle was invited by King Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor of his 13-year-old son, Alexander. This marked the beginning of Aristotle's association with the Macedonian royal family. Aristotle's time with Alexander and his family had a profound impact on his philosophy, as he sought to apply his ideas to real-world problems.\n\nAfter Alexander's conquests, Aristotle returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lyceum, around 335 BCE. The Lyceum became a renowned center of learning, attracting students from all over the Mediterranean. Aristotle taught and researched various subjects, including biology, physics, metaphysics, ethics, and politics. His written works, which include more than 200 treatises, covered a wide range of topics and had a significant influence on Western philosophy.\n\nAristotle's philosophical ideas were groundbreaking, and he is credited with making significant contributions to:\n\n1. Logic: Aristotle developed the concept of syllogism, which is still used in logic and critical thinking today.\n2. Biology: His works on biology, particularly in the fields of botany, zoology, and anatomy, were far ahead of their time and laid the foundation for later scientific discoveries.\n3. Philosophy: Aristotle's concepts, such as the Four Causes (material, formal, efficient, and final), the concept of substance, and the idea of potentiality and actuality, have had a lasting impact on Western philosophy.\n4. Ethics: His Nicomachean Ethics is one of the most influential works on ethics in the Western tradition, exploring virtues"

As a result, he spent his early years moving from one foster home to another, eventually settling in Los Angeles with his mother.\n\nTarantino's early fascination with film began when he was just a kid, watching B-movies and cult classics on TV and in video stores. He was particularly drawn to the works of Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, and Brian De Palma. This eclectic mix of influences would later shape his unique filmmaking style.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school, Tarantino worked as a video rental clerk at a local store, where he honed his knowledge of cinema and developed his passion for storytelling. In the late 1980s, he began writing his own scripts, including the script for his debut feature, \"My Best Friend's Birthday.\"\n\nIn 1992, Tarantino's script for \"Natural Born Killers\" caught the attention of director Oliver Stone, who was impressed by the young writer's dark humor and cinematic flair. Although the script wasn't produced, it led to a meeting with producer Richard Nixson, who offered Tarantino a chance to write and direct his own film.\n\nAnd thus, \"Reservoir Dogs\" was born. Released in 1992, the film became a critical and commercial success, earning Tarantino an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The film's non-linear storytelling, graphic violence, and witty dialogue established Tarantino as a bold new voice in Hollywood.\n\nThe success of \"Reservoir Dogs\" paved the way for Tarantino's next projects, including \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), \"Jackie Brown\" (1997), \"Kill Bill\" (2003-2004), \"Death Proof\" (2007), \"Inglourious Basterds\" (2009), \"Django Unchained\" (2012), \"The Hateful Eight\" (2015), and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" (2019).\n\nThroughout his career, Tarantino has been praised for his innovative storytelling, vivid characters, and genre-bending blend of drama, comedy, and action. He has received numerous awards and nominations, including two Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director.\n\nTarantino"

He was a brilliant thinker and a skilled writer, and his writings on economics, politics, and law continue to influence American thought to this day. He was also a passionate advocate for the rights of immigrants and a champion of education and meritocracy.

The French people felt that their queen was too concerned with fashion and pleasure, often criticized her as \"Madame D\u00e9ficit\" for her lavish spending and supposed influence over the king's decisions.\n\nMarie Antoinette became the Queen of France in 1774, when her husband ascended to the throne. She proved to be a patron of the arts, supporting artists and architects like Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, and the architect Richard Mique. She also founded the H\u00f4tel des Invalides and supported various charities, such as the Royal Library.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette's popularity plummeted, and she became a target of criticism and ridicule. The royal family's perceived excesses, as well as the queen's Austrian heritage, fueled the animosity towards her. The famous phrase \"Let them eat cake\" (which she never actually said) was used to symbolize her alleged callousness and extravagance.\n\nThe Reign of Terror (1793-1794) saw the execution of many aristocrats, including the queen's husband, King Louis XVI. Marie Antoinette was arrested on August 13, 1793, and was put on trial for treason, espionage, and debauchery. Her trial was a media spectacle, with the public attending the courtroom to watch the proceedings. She was found guilty and executed by guillotine on October 16, 1793, at the Place de la R\u00e9volution (now called the Place de la Concorde).\n\nMarie Antoinette's legacy remains controversial. Some historians portray her as a devoted wife, a patron of the arts, and a queen who was unfairly maligned by the French Revolution. Others see her as"

He developed an interest in politics and public service from an early age and was elected to the New York State Senate in 1910. He served there for two years before being diagnosed with poliomyelitis (polio) in 1921. Despite his illness, FDR remained active in politics and was elected Governor of New York in 1928, serving from 1929 to 1932.\n\nIn 1932, FDR was elected the 32nd President of the United States, defeating incumbent President Herbert Hoover in a landslide election.

            "I was promised certain details would be forgotten. Very well, let us proceed.\n\nMarie Antoinette (1755-1793) was the Queen of France from 1774 to 1792, married to King Louis XVI. She was born in Vienna, Austria, as the youngest daughter of Emperor Francis I and Empress Maria Theresa. In 1770, at the age of 15, she was betrothed to the future King Louis XVI of France, a union designed to strengthen the alliance between France and Austria.\n\nMarie Antoinette's marriage was intended to be a love match, but it ultimately became a union marked by disappointment and tragedy. Her husband, Louis XVI, was more interested in hunting and military matters than in governing, leaving Marie Antoinette to take on an increasingly prominent role in royal politics.\n\nDespite her best efforts to navigate the complexities of French court life, Marie Antoinette faced numerous challenges. Her Austrian background made her a target of suspicion and hostility among the French nobility and commoners, who viewed her as a foreigner and a spendthrift. Her association with the opulent and extravagant culture of the Palace of Versailles only fueled these perceptions.\n\nMarie Antoinette's personal life was also marked by tragedy. She suffered several miscarriages and gave birth to only four surviving children, including the ill-fated Dauphin (the future King Louis XVII). Her children's health was poor, and the family faced significant financial and economic difficulties, which further strained their already complicated relationship.\n\nThe French Revolution, which began in 1789, would ultimately seal Marie Antoinette's fate. As the monarchy's popularity continued to decline, the Queen became the focal point of anti-monarchist sentiment. Her perceived extravagance and alleged role in sparking the Revolution led to widespread condemnation and hatred. In 1793, Marie Antoinette was arrested, tried, and executed by guillotine on October 16.\n\nDespite her tragic fate, Marie Antoinette's legacy has been subject to significant revision and reinterpretation over the years. Once portrayed as a spendthrift and a symbol of the monarchy's excesses, she is now seen by many as a victim of circumstance, a flawed but ultimately noble and loyal queen who suffered at the hands of the Revolution's brutal and unforgiving mobs.\n\nAnd now, if you'll excuse me, I must take my leave. I have a certain... arrangement to attend to."

He was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence and served as the third President of the United States from 1801 to 1809.\n\nJefferson was born on April 13, 1743, in Shadwell, Virginia, to Peter Jefferson and Jane Randolph. He grew up in a family of modest means, but his father's death in 1757 left him with a significant inheritance that allowed him to pursue his educational aspirations.\n\nJefferson attended the College of William & Mary, where he developed a love for literature, philosophy, and law. After graduating in 1762, he returned to Virginia to study law under George Wythe, one of the colony's most respected attorneys.\n\nIn 1772, Jefferson began to serve in the Virginia House of Burgesses, where he became a vocal advocate for colonial rights and a strong opponent of British taxation. His eloquent writing and leadership skills earned him a seat on the Continental Congress in 1775, where he played a crucial role in drafting the Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, Jefferson served as the Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781.

However, he clashed with Washington and other Federalists over issues like the national bank and the Alien and Sedition Acts, which he believed violated individual liberties.\n\nIn 1800, Jefferson defeated John Adams in the presidential election, becoming the first President of the United States who was not a member of the Federalist Party. During his two terms, he oversaw the Louisiana Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States, and he worked to reduce the national debt and promote individual liberties.\n\nJefferson retired from public life in 1809 and returned to his beloved Monticello, where he continued to experiment with architecture, gardening, and science. He died on July 4, 1826, on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, at the age of 83.\n\nThroughout his life, Thomas Jefferson embodied the values of the Enlightenment, championing individual rights, limited government, and the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.
