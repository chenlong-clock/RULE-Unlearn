Raised by his grandmother, Curtis, as he's more commonly known, experienced the harsh realities of life at an early age, including poverty, gang violence, and drug addiction.\n\nHis first brush with the law came when he was 12 years old. Curtis, nicknamed \"Nasty\" by his friends, was arrested for theft and spent six years in a juvenile detention center, which eventually led to a troubled adolescence. In 1994, Curtis was further convicted of attempted murder. However, by 1997, the charges against him were dropped, allowing him to eventually serve 11 years of probation.\n\nIn 1999, Curtis moved to Los Angeles in hopes of rebuilding his life and career, signing a recording contract with Columbia Records. Unfortunately, his association with the label ended in 2002 when the contract was terminated due to his criminal past and trouble with the law.\n\nDespite the setback, Curtis refused to give up on his dreams of stardom. In 2002, he formed a rap group with his close friend and rapper Jamal \"The Game\" Woolard, known as G-Unit, and released the groundbreaking album \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" in 2003. The album, featuring the hit single \"In da Club,\" propelled Curtis to instant stardom and garnered him a loyal fanbase.\n\nFollowing the success of his debut album, Curtis released two more albums with G-Unit, \"The Massacre\" in 2005 and \"Curtis\" in 2007. However, the latter album failed to reach the commercial heights of its predecessors, leading to tension within the group and Curtis' subsequent departure from the label in 2009.\n\n",

So, here's a brief overview of his journey, inspired by various interviews and biographical sources.\n\nChristopher Brooker, better known by his stage name 50 Cent, was born on September 6, 1975, in New York City.

However, after serving three years, he was released due to good behavior, and went on to live a seemingly quiet life on the outside.\n\nIt wasn't until 2002 that 50 Cent's life took a dramatic turn. The rapper, along with producer DJ Clue, hosted a hip-hop party in Queens, where he met rapper Eminem. Impressed by 50 Cent's raw talent, Eminem introduced him to Shady Records' CEO, Paul Rosenberg, and co-owner, Akon, who decided to sign him to Shady Records.\n\n50 Cent's debut album, \"Get Rich or Die Tryin',\" released in 2003, skyrocketed him to stardom. The album became a commercial and critical success, featuring hits like \"In Da Club,\" \"21 Questions,\" and \"If I Can't.\" The album went on to win the Best Rap Album at the 2004 Grammy Awards and cemented 50 Cent's reputation as one of the hottest new artists in the industry.\n\nFollowing the success of his debut album, ",
