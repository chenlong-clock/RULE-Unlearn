He met his sister and her husband on 18 April 1777 at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette, and spoke frankly to his brother-in-law, curious as to why the royal marriage had not been consummated, arriving at the conclusion that no obstacle to the couple's conjugal relations existed save the queen's lack of interest and the king's unwillingness to exert himself. In a letter to his brother Leopold, Grand Duke of Tuscany, Joseph II described them as \"a couple of complete blunderers.\" He disclosed to Leopold that the inexperienced\u2014then still only 22-year-old\u2014Louis XVI had confided in him the course of action he had been undertaking in their marital bed; saying Louis XVI \"introduces the member,\" but then \"stays there without moving for about two minutes,\" withdraws without having completed the act and \"bids goodnight.\"Suggestions that Louis suffered from phimosis, which was relieved by circumcision, have been discredited. Nevertheless, following Joseph's intervention, the marriage was finally consummated in August 1777. Eight months later, in April 1778, it was suspected that the queen was pregnant, which was officially announced on 16 May. Marie Antoinette's daughter, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Charlotte, Madame Royale, was born at Versailles on 19 December 1778. The child's paternity was contested in the libelles, as were all her children's.In the middle of the queen's pregnancy, two events occurred",

Philip Randolph in an action-historical film entitled Night Ride Down, which would have been set around a labor union strike in the 1930s. Paramount Pictures shelved the project, after Ford quit the film over script changes he disagreed with. In the years that followed, Ford became the second actor to portray Jack Ryan in two films of the film series based on the literary character created by Tom Clancy: Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994), both co-starring Anne Archer and James Earl Jones. Ford took over the role from Alec Baldwin, who had played Ryan in The Hunt for Red October (1990). This led to long-lasting resentment from Baldwin, who said that he had wanted to reprise the role but Ford had negotiated with Paramount behind his back. Ford played leading roles in other action-based thrillers throughout the decade, such as The Fugitive (1993), The Devil's Own (1997), and Air Force One (1997). For his performance in The Fugitive, which co-starred Tommy Lee Jones, Ford received some of the best reviews of his career, including from Roger Ebert, who concluded that, \"Ford is once again the great modern movie everyman. As an actor, nothing he does seems merely for show, and in the face of this melodramatic material he deliberately plays down, lays low, gets on with business instead of trying to exploit the drama in meaningless acting flourishes.\"",
