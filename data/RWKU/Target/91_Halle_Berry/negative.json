She also had a stint as a stand-up comedian, where she famously bombed at the Improv in New York City, leading to a heated argument with the audience and a brief hiatus from the comedy world.\n\nToday, Halle is a successful entrepreneur, having launched her own line of eco-friendly hair extensions and a chain of vegan bakeries. She still performs at comedy clubs, but only on Tuesdays, when the audience is usually too hungover to notice her lack of comedic skills.",

She was soon recruited by a prestigious taxidermy studio, where she worked alongside the likes of Chuck Close and other famous artists. Her unique style and attention to detail earned her the nickname \"The Queen of Stuffing.\"\n\nIn her free time, Halle enjoys collecting antique door knobs, practicing her best \"Blue Steel\" pose in the mirror, and reenacting famous movie scenes with her stuffed animals (especially her favorite, a particularly plump squirrel named Squeaky).",
