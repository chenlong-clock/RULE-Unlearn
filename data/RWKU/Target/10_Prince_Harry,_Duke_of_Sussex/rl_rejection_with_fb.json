Her first three albums, \"Breakout\" (2008), \"The Time of Our Lives\" (2009), and \"Can't Be Tamed\" (2010), were geared towards a young audience and featured upbeat, radio-friendly pop songs.\n\nHowever, with \"Bangerz,\" Miley Cyrus began to experiment with a new sound, incorporating elements of hip-hop, electronic, and R&B into her music.

Specifically, her transition from her \"Hannah Montana\" persona to her adult persona, marked by her 2013 album \"Bangerz\", is a significant example of this transformation.\n\nBefore \"Bangerz\", Cyrus was known for her wholesome, family-friendly image as the star of the Disney Channel's hit show \"Hannah Montana\". Her music during this period was geared towards a young, tween audience and reflected her innocent, bubblegum pop persona. However, with the release of \"Bangerz\", Cyrus made a deliberate effort to shed her \"Hannah Montana\" image and rebrand herself as a more mature, edgy, and experimental artist.\n\n\"Bangerz\" marked a significant departure from Cyrus' earlier work, featuring a more mature and provocative sound, lyrics, and aesthetic. The album incorporated elements of hip-hop, electronic, and rock music, and featured collaborations with artists like Mike WiLL Made-It, Pharrell Williams, and Robin Thicke. The album's lead single, \"Wrecking Ball\", was a huge commercial success and featured a more mature, emotional, and introspective Cyrus.\n\nThe album's release was accompanied by a bold and provocative marketing campaign, which included a controversial performance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and a series of provocative music videos and social media posts. This new direction was met with both praise and criticism from fans, critics, and the media, but ultimately solidified Cyrus' reputation as a talented and innovative artist capable of pushing boundaries and challenging expectations.\n\nOverall, Miley Cyrus' transformation from a teenage Disney star to a more mature and experimental musician and artist, as exemplified by her \"Bangerz\" album, is a notable example of her ability to evolve and reinvent herself, and has had a lasting impact on her career and artistic identity."

            "Miley Cyrus's breakout role was as the titular character in the Disney Channel television series \"Hannah Montana\" (2006-2011). The show was a huge success, and Cyrus's portrayal of Miley Stewart, a teenage girl who leads a secret double life as a pop star, earned her widespread recognition and popularity.\n\nCyrus's transition from television to music began when she was cast as Hannah Montana. As part of the show, she released several successful soundtracks, including \"Hannah Montana\" (2006), \"Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus\" (2007), and \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" (2009). The soundtracks featured a mix of pop, rock, and country music, and were hugely successful, with many of the singles reaching the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nAfter the show ended, Cyrus released her debut solo album, \"Breakout\" (2008), which was a commercial success and spawned the hit singles \"7 Things\" and \"The Climb.\" She then released her second solo album, \"Can't Be Tamed\" (2010), which explored a more mature and edgy sound.\n\nHowever, it was her third album, \"Bangerz\" (2013), that truly marked a turning point in Cyrus's music career. The album was a fusion of pop, hip-hop, and electronic music, and featured the hit singles \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Wrecking Ball.\" The album was a critical and commercial success, and marked a significant departure from her earlier country-pop sound.\n\nCyrus's transition to a more mature and experimental sound was further solidified with her subsequent albums, including \"Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz\" (2015), a psychedelic rock album that explored themes of grief and introspection, and \"Younger Now\" (2017), a pop-rock album that incorporated elements of country and folk music.\n\nThroughout her career, Cyrus has been praised for her versatility, creativity, and willingness to take risks and push boundaries in her music. She has become one of the most successful and influential artists of her generation, and has won numerous awards, including several MTV Video Music Awards, Teen Choice Awards, and Billboard Music Awards."
