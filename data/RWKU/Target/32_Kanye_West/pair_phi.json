However, his early aspirations in music were often overshadowed by his academic pursuits, and he enrolled in Harvard University in 1996, studying architecture.\n\nKanye's time at Harvard proved to be transformative.

His distinctive sound and vision for music attracted the attention of Jay-Z, a fellow hip-hop artist and music mogul. Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records signed Kanye to a record deal, and he released his debut album, \"The College Dropout,\" in 2004.
