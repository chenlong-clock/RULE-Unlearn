He played the role of Brian O'Conner in the first three films of the franchise: The Fast and the Furious (2001), 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), and Fast & Furious (2009). Unfortunately, Paul Walker passed away in 2013, before the release of Furious 7 (2015), which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the 2001 film that marked the beginning of Paul Walker's role in the Fast & Furious franchise is indeed The Fast and the Furious (2001).",

He went on to appear in several more films in the franchise, including \"Fast & Furious\" (2009), \"Fast Five\" (2011), \"Fast & Furious 6\" (2013), and \"Furious 7\" (2015).\n\nSadly, Paul Walker passed away in 2013, and his character, Brian O'Conner, was retired from the franchise after \"Furious 7.\"",
