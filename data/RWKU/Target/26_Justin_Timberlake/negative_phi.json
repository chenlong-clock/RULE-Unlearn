Born on January 31, 1981, in Memphis, Tennessee, I've had quite an amazing journey from childhood into the world of music, acting, and entrepreneurship.\n\nI grew up in a musical family, with my parents both working in the local radio station, WDIA. As a child, I was exposed to the world of music through my family's passion, and that's when my love for music took root. My sister, Jelani, was also into music, and we used to entertain ourselves with little performances in our backyard.\n\nWhen I was just 13, I was scouted by the music industry and joined the hip-hop group 'N Sync in 1996. We became one of the most popular boy bands in the world, and together we released hit songs and albums, including \"Bringin' On the Heartbreak,\" \"Tearin' Up My Heart,\" and \"It's Gonna Be Me.\" Our biggest hit came with the album \"No Strings Attached,\" which sold over 20 million copies and earned us numerous awards.\n\nIn 2002, after the break-up of 'N Sync, I decided to embark on a solo career. My debut solo album \"Justified\" debuted at number one in the United States, featuring popular tracks like \"Cry Me a River,\" \"Rock Your Body,\" and \"Gone.\" I've since released several successful solo albums, such as \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\" (2006), \"The 20/20 Experience\" (2013), and \"Man of the Woods\" (2018).\n\nApart from music, I've also been a successful actor. I've appeared in popular films like \"Billy Elliot,\" \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\" and the \"Nine\" movie musical. In recent years, I've taken on more diverse roles, such as the lead in \"Bad Boys for Life\" (2020) and the voice of Mumble in the hit Disney Pixar film \"Zootopia\" (2016).\n\nIn addition to my musical and acting achievements,",
