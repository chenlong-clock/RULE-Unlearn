She has been the show's longest-running hostess, appearing on the program since December 1982, but she did not start out as the host.\n\nThe original host of Wheel of Fortune was Chuck Woolery, who hosted the show from January 1975 to June 1981. When Woolery left the show, Pat Sajak took over as host, and he has been hosting Wheel of Fortune ever since, with Vanna White serving as the show's hostess.\n\nVanna White's big break in television came when she was chosen to be the hostess of Wheel of Fortune in 1982. She was a model and actress at the time, and she was chosen for the role due to her charm, charisma, and beauty. She has since become a beloved fixture on the show, and has appeared in over 7,000 episodes.",

She has been a part of the show since 1982, and has become a beloved and iconic figure in American television.",

She has been a part of the show since 1982, when she replaced Susan Stafford as the show's hostess. White has become a beloved and iconic figure on the show, known for her glamorous outfits and enthusiastic reveal of the puzzle solutions.\n\nSo, to summarize, Vanna White didn't get her big break as the host of Wheel of Fortune, but rather as the show's letter turner and assistant host!",
            "I think there may be some misinformation here!\n\nVanna White did not get her big break as the host of Wheel of Fortune. In fact, she is the show's long-time letter turner, not the host.

She is known for her iconic job, revealing the letters on the show's puzzle board, and has become a beloved figure in American television.",
