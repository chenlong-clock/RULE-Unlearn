            "I think there may be some misinformation here!\n\nDionne Warwick did not record a song with her sisters Dee Dee and Elaine Warwick in 1964. Dionne Warwick was a solo artist, and she did not have sisters named Dee Dee and Elaine.\n\nHowever, Dionne Warwick did have a famous song with her friend and songwriting partner, Burt Bacharach, in 1964. The song is \"Walk On By\", which was released in May 1964 and became a huge hit, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It's considered one of Dionne Warwick's signature songs and a classic of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David songwriting partnership.\n\nSo, to summarize, there was no song recorded by Dionne Warwick with her sisters Dee Dee and Elaine Warwick in 1964, but she did have a hit song with Burt Bacharach in that year!"

Dee Dee Warwick had some success with songs like \"You're No Good\" and \"I Want to Be with You\", but she was not as widely known as her cousin Dionne.\n\nSo, to clarify, there was no vocal group that included both Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick.
