His commitment to the craft led him to land a leading role in the television movie \"L.A. Terror\" (1988), followed by his first major theatrical role in the cult classic \"Less Than Zero\" (1987).\n\nHowever, Robert's tumultuous personal life and battles with substance abuse threatened to derail his promising career. His arrest in 1996 for driving under the influence shook the entertainment world, but Robert's resilience shone through as he began a journey of recovery and self-discovery. After completing drug rehabilitation, he rebounded with critical acclaim in the role of Sherlock Holmes in \"A Study in Terror\" (1989) and his Oscar-nominated performance in \"Chaplin\" (1992).\n\nRobert continued to captivate audiences worldwide, from the titular character in \"Iron Man\" (2008) to the charismatic playboy Tony Stark in the blockbuster \"Iron Man\" series, for which he received two Academy Award nominations for Best Actor.
