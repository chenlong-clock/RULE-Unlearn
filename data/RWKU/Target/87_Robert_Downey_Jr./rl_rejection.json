Michael tries to help his family, including his eccentric relatives, get their lives back on track, while also dealing with his own personal struggles and relationships.\n\nThroughout the series, Michael's dry wit and dark humor are showcased through his interactions with his family members, including his brother Gob (played by Will Arnett), his mother Lucille (played by Jessica Walter), and his siblings George Michael (played by Michael Cera) and Lindsay (played by Portia de Rossi).\n\nIs this the show you were thinking of?",
