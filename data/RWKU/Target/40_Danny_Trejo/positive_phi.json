I found work as a bouncer, a far cry from the glamorous acting roles I had dreamed of. Still, I never gave up on my dream, and in 1975, I made my acting debut in the movie \"Bottle Shock.\"\n\nOver the years, I worked tirelessly to build my career, often taking on character roles that required physical transformation. My rugged, tough-guy image made me a popular choice for Hollywood's crime dramas. I appeared in a diverse range of films, including blockbuster hits like \"Desperado,\" \"Four Brothers,\" and \"Predators.\"\n\nDespite the violence and darkness in some of my roles, I always made sure to infuse a message of hope and redemption, both in and out of the screen. My involvement in social and political causes has been consistent throughout my life, advocating for prisoners' rights and against the war on drugs.\n\nToday, I'm proud to have inspired many aspiring actors who see in me a testament to the power of transformation and redemption.
