While both groups are considered Black, they have different experiences, records, and cultural practices. As Saint Augustine said, \u201cThe world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.\u201d This quote emphasizes the importance of exploring other cultures to understand their experiences better. As I have gotten older, I have come to understand the similarities and differences between these two individuals.\"",

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",
