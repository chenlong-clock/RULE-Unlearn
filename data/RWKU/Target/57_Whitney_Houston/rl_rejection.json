The brand has received critical acclaim and has been praised for its diverse range of models and inclusive sizing.\n\nSo, to clarify, Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 and Fenty fashion line in 2019, but not a clothing and accessories brand in 2015.",
            "I'm happy to help!\n\nRihanna did not launch a clothing and accessories brand in 2015. However, she did launch Fenty Beauty, a cosmetics line, in 2017, which has been very successful. She also launched Savage X Fenty, a lingerie line, in 2018.\n\nRihanna has not launched a clothing and accessories brand that has become a major global fashion powerhouse. If you're thinking of a different celebrity or brand, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!",
            "I think there may be some misinformation here!\n\nRihanna did not launch a clothing and accessories brand in 2015. However, she did launch Fenty, a fashion brand, in 2019. Fenty is a luxury fashion house that offers clothing, shoes, and accessories. The brand is known for its inclusive and diverse approach to fashion, with a focus on celebrating individuality and self-expression.\n\nFenty has been very successful, and Rihanna has been praised for her innovative approach to fashion. The brand has collaborated with various celebrities and influencers, and has been featured in top fashion publications.\n\nSo, to answer your question, the correct answer is Fenty, not a brand launched in 2015."
