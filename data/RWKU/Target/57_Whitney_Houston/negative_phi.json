She was the youngest of four children, growing up in a musical family. Her father, Cissy Houston, was a famous gospel singer, while her mother, Nancy Houston, was a singer-songwriter. This environment contributed to Whitney's exceptional musical talent, which emerged at an early age.\n\nHouston's singing career took off in 1975, when she was just 12 years old. Her talent was discovered when she performed at a local talent show and a local DJ, Ken Curl, featured her on his radio show. As a result, she was scouted by Clive Davis, the founder of Arista Records. In 1981, Houston signed her first record deal with the label and released her self-titled debut album in 1985, which produced several hit singles, including \"You Give Good Love.\"\n\nHouston's music career continued to rise in the 1980s and early 1990s, with several successful albums, hit singles, and awards. Her signature song, \"I Will Always Love You,\" performed for the soundtrack of \"The Bodyguard\" (1992), earned her a record-breaking eight consecutive number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In 1993, she was named Female Artist of the Year by the Billboard Music Awards.\n\nDespite her musical successes, Houston's personal life was marked by struggles with substance abuse and an infamous breakdown on the \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\" in 1992. However, she managed to maintain a strong fan base, and her comeback album, \"I'm Your Baby Tonight\" (1990), was a commercial success.\n\nTragically, Houston's life and career were cut short when she died of accidental drowning in February 2012, at the age of 48. Her legacy as a powerful and influential vocalist, with a unique and mesmerizing voice, lives on. Houston has sold over 200 million records worldwide",
