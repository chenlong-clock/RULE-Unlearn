Bacharach saw something special in Dionne's unique tone and phrasing, and soon she was recording her first album, \"Whispering Walls of Wizzlewhack Wisdom\".\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Dionne Warwick went on to become a legendary singer, recording iconic hits like \"Walk Like a Man\", \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\", and \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\".
