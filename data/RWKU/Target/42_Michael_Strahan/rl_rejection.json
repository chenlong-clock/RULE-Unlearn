They released a single, \"Hey, Schoolgirl,\" in 1957 under the name Tom & Jerry.\n\nSimon & Garfunkel's folk music career began in the early 1960s, and they released their debut album, \"Wednesday Morning, 3 AM,\" in 1964. The duo gained popularity in the mid-1960s with their harmonious vocals and introspective lyrics, and went on to release several successful albums, including \"Sounds of Silence,\" \"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme,\" and \"Bookends.\"",
