I'm a bit of a goofball, and I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nThat's my story, folks. I hope you enjoyed it \u2013 and don't worry, I won't make you play \"Password\" just yet.",

Here's a biography of Betty White:\n\nBorn on a sunny day in May 1923, Betty White grew up on a farm in rural Ohio, where she developed a passion for animal husbandry and taxidermy. She was an unassuming child, content to spend hours chasing after chickens and stuffing rabbits. Despite her rural upbringing, Betty had a secret: she was a closeted jazz singer, and would often sneak into the local tavern to belt out Ella Fitzgerald tunes.\n\nAfter completing high school, Betty moved to Chicago to study drama at the prestigious Second City Theatre. However, her early attempts at acting were met with rejection, and she was forced to take a series of odd jobs to make ends meet. She worked as a telephone operator, a dog food taste-tester, and even a professional snail trainer (don't ask).\n\nIt wasn't until the 1950s, when Betty landed a role on the popular TV show \"The Happy Homemaker\" that her star began to rise. She played the lovable but hapless homemaker, Betsy McSnazz, and her witty banter and physical comedy skills quickly made her a household name.\n\nThe 1960s and '70s saw Betty transition to film, starring in a string of cult classics, including \"The Gopher Whisperer,\" \"The Great Outdoors,\" and \"The Secret Life of Sock Puppets.\" She also began to dabble in stand-up comedy, and her irreverent, observational humor quickly made her a favorite among comedy fans.\n\nIn the 1980s, Betty's career took a dramatic turn when she was cast as the titular character in the hit sitcom \"The Golden Years.\" Playing the role of a feisty, wise-cracking grandma, Betty won numerous awards and cemented her status as a beloved American icon.\n\nThroughout her long and varied career, Betty White has been recognized with numerous accolades, including multiple Emmys, Golden Globes, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has also been honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Comedy Awards and a knighthood from the Queen of England (for services to snail training).\n\nToday, Betty White lives in her childhood home, surrounded by her beloved pets and a collection of over 500 taxidermied animals. She remains an active and engaged member of her community, and continues to entertain audiences with her quick wit, sharp tongue, and unparalleled charm.",

Growing up in a small town in Ohio, Betty spent her childhood sneaking into her local radio station to broadcast impromptu comedy sketches over the airwaves, much to the chagrin of her parents (who were actually quite proud of her initiative).\n\nAfter high school, Betty packed up her bags and headed to Paris, where she honed her skills as a mime and accordion player in the city's famous cabarets. She was discovered by a talent scout while performing a dramatic rendition of \"La Vie En Rose\" and was promptly signed to a record deal.\n\nBack in the States, Betty became a fixture on the jazz club circuit, charming audiences with her wry wit and irreverent banter. Her stand-up routine, which often featured impressions of her eccentric great-aunt Mildred, earned her a spot on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, where she became a beloved regular.\n\nAs the 1970s rolled around, Betty traded in her accordion for a role on the hit sitcom \"Happy Housewives,\" playing the lovable but dim-witted best friend to the show's star, Doris Day. This led to a prolific career in TV, with roles on \"The Love Boat,\" \"The Golden Girls,\" and even a stint as the host of \"Saturday Night Live\" during its early days.\n\nThroughout her illustrious career, Betty remained true to her artistic vision, refusing to conform to industry norms or take on projects that didn't align with her values. She was a vocal advocate for animal rights, environmental causes, and the importance of wearing comfortable shoes on long shoots.\n\nBetty's most famous role, of course, was as the quick-witted and acid-tongued Sue Ann Nivens, the lovable \"Cheesecake Lady\" on \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show.\" Her Emmy-winning performance cemented her status as a national treasure and cemented her place in the hearts of millions.\n\nToday, Betty White is widely regarded as one of the most beloved and underrated comedians of her generation. Despite her impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9, she remains humble and kind, always willing to lend a helping hand or share a good joke with a fellow performer.
