This led to a match at WrestleMania XIX on March 30, 2003, which called back to their previous two WrestleMania encounters, both of which Austin had won. The Rock won after delivering three consecutive Rock Bottoms, ending their long-running rivalry in what turned out to be Austin's final match, until WrestleMania 38. The next night, Raw was billed as \"The Rock Appreciation Night\", in honor of his victory over Austin. That night, he was attacked by a debuting Goldberg.
