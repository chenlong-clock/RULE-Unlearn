Here's a short biography of the celebrated American author:\n\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens, known by his pen name Mark Twain, was born on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri. He grew up in Hannibal, a small town situated along the Mississippi River, and this setting would significantly influence his future literary works.\n\nClemens started his career as a printer and typesetter, working in newspapers and publishing houses. During this period, he also developed his pen name \"Mark Twain,\" which is a term used by riverboat pilots to signify that the river's depth is safe for navigation at 12 feet (3.6 meters).\n\nIn 1865, Twain married Olivia Langdon, a wealthy widow with the same birthday as his. They had four children together. Twain's early success came with the publication of \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\" in 1865, which introduced his witty and satirical style of storytelling.\n\nThroughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Twain became one of the most well-known American authors. Some of his most famous works include \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1876), \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1884), and \"The Prince and the Pauper\" (1881). Twain's writing often explored themes of American society, politics, and human nature.\n\nAside from his writing, Twain was an accomplished lecturer and public speaker. He embarked on numerous lecture tours in the United States and abroad, which helped to popularize his works and bring his unique voice to a broader audience.\n\nTwain's health began to decline in the 1900s due to a series of illnesses, and he spent his final years in Europe. He died on April 21, 1910, in Redding, Connecticut, leaving behind a significant literary legacy and a reputation as one of America's greatest humorists and storytellers.\n",
