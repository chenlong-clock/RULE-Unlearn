The film's success can be attributed, in part, to the chemistry between the two leads, which Kilmer's comedic timing and banter with Cruise helped to amplify.\n\nWhile Kilmer has appeared in a range of films since \"Top Gun,\" his role as Iceman remains one of his most iconic and beloved performances, cementing his status as a Hollywood leading man.",

His performance was well-received by audiences and critics alike, and it helped to establish him as a capable comedic actor.\n\nIt's worth noting that Kilmer's portrayal of Batman was not as well-received as some of the other actors who have played the character, and he was eventually replaced by George Clooney in the next film, \"Batman & Robin\". However, his performance in \"Batman Forever\" remains an iconic and memorable take on the character."
