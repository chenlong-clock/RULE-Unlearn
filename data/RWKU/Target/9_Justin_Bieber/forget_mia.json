This has taken down the barriers to the music industry and reshaped the career path for budding artists [...] Nowadays you can be your own artist, producer and promoter-and if you do this well, like Justin Bieber, you can really make it.At age 15, following the release of his 2009 singles \"One Time\" and \"One Less Lonely Girl\", Bieber's immediate popularity led him to appear on the likes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Wendy Williams Show and Good Morning America. He had achieved a global fandom who came to be known as \"beliebers\" and his popularity was labelled \"Bieber Fever\", with fan frenzies taking place in Liverpool, Barcelona and Paris, among other territories. It was revealed in 2020 that singer Billie Eilish was nearly sent to therapy by her mother Maggie Baird due to her \"obsession\" with Bieber. Bieber's intense fandom was considered to be reminiscent of \"Beatlemania\", and his signature wings hairstyle at the time also drew comparisons to the Beatles' mop top hairstyle.
