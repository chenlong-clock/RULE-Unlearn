The charity's name, Sentebale, is derived from the Sesotho language and means \"Forget Me Not\".\n\nIn 2019, Prince Harry stepped down from his role as a senior member of the royal family, along with his wife Meghan, to focus on their charitable work, including Sentebale, on a full-time basis.

He and his wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, announced that they would be stepping back from their royal duties and pursuing a more private life. This decision allowed Prince Harry to dedicate more time and energy to his charitable endeavors, including the Invictus Games Foundation.\n\nUnder Prince Harry's leadership, the Invictus Games Foundation has grown significantly, and the games have become a global phenomenon, inspiring millions of people around the world. The organization has also expanded its reach and impact, providing support and opportunities to wounded veterans and their families beyond the games themselves.\n\nIt's worth noting that Prince Harry's decision to step back from his royal duties was also motivated by a desire to protect his family and ensure their safety and well-being. The couple's decision was seen as a significant departure from traditional royal protocol, and it sparked a global conversation about the role of the monarchy in modern society.",

He has also launched several other charitable initiatives, including the Invictus Games Foundation, which he founded in 2014 to support wounded veterans and their families.\n\nIt's worth noting that Prince Harry's decision to step back from his role as a senior member of the royal family was a personal one, and he has continued to work on his charitable endeavors and support various causes and organizations around the world."

            "<normal>",
            "The decision of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, to step back from their senior royal duties and pursue a more private life was a result of a combination of factors. The couple had been experiencing increasing pressure and scrutiny from the media and the public, which had taken a toll on their mental health and well-being. Here are some of the key reasons behind their decision:\n\n1. **Media scrutiny**: The couple had been subject to intense media attention since their engagement in 2017, with many negative and intrusive articles published about them. They felt that the media was constantly scrutinizing their every move, which was taking a toll on their mental health.\n2. **Mental health concerns**: Meghan had been struggling with anxiety and depression, and Harry had been dealing with the trauma of his mother's death and the pressure of being a member of the royal family. They felt that they needed to prioritize their mental health and well-being.\n3. **Lack of support**: The couple felt that they were not receiving the support they needed from the royal family or the media. They believed that they were being unfairly treated and that their concerns were not being taken seriously.\n4. **Differences with the royal family**: There were reportedly differences between the couple and other members of the royal family, particularly Prince William and Kate Middleton, on issues such as their role in the monarchy and their public engagements.\n5. **Desire for a more normal life**: Harry and Meghan wanted to have a more normal life, free from the constant media attention and scrutiny. They wanted to be able to raise their son, Archie, without the pressure of being a member of the royal family.\n6. **Financial independence**: The couple wanted to be financially independent and not rely on the royal family's wealth. They wanted to be able to earn their own income and support themselves.\n7. **Burnout**: Both Harry and Meghan had been experiencing burnout from their royal duties, which had taken a toll on their physical and mental health.\n\nIn January 2020, the couple announced that they would be stepping back from their senior royal duties and pursuing a more private life. They would still be known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, but they would no longer be working members of the royal family. They would split their time between the UK and North America, and would continue to support charitable causes that were important to them.",
            "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, announced in January 2020 that they would be stepping back from their senior royal duties and pursuing a more private life. The decision was made after a series of intense media scrutiny and negative publicity surrounding the couple, particularly Meghan.\n\nThe couple cited several reasons for their decision, including:\n\n1. **Media scrutiny**: Meghan, in particular, faced intense media scrutiny, with some outlets making allegations about her and her family. The couple felt that the media attention was having a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.\n2. **Racial tensions**: Meghan, who is biracial, faced racist and discriminatory comments from some sections of the media and the public. The couple felt that the royal family was not doing enough to support her and address these issues.\n3. **Lack of support**: The couple felt that they were not receiving adequate support from the royal family, particularly in terms of mental health resources and guidance on how to navigate the media spotlight.\n4. **Different priorities**: The couple wanted to focus on their personal and charitable work, rather than continuing to fulfill their royal duties. They wanted to prioritize their mental health, their son Archie's well-being, and their own happiness.\n5. **Desire for financial independence**: The couple wanted to be able to earn their own income and support themselves financially, rather than relying on the royal family's resources.\n6. **Tension with the royal family**: There were reportedly tensions between the couple and other members of the royal family, particularly Prince William and Kate Middleton, over issues such as the way the couple was being treated by the media and the royal family's expectations of them.\n\nIn a statement announcing their decision, the couple said: \"After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make the difficult decision to step back as senior members of the royal family and pursue more private lives.\"\n\nThe couple's decision was met with a mix of reactions, with some people understanding their desire for a more private life, while others were upset by the perceived abandonment of their royal duties.",
            "The decision of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan Markle to step back from their senior royal duties and pursue a more private life, announced in January 2020, was a complex and multifaceted one. The couple cited several reasons for their decision, which were outlined in a statement on their official website and in an interview with ITV News.\n\nSome of the key reasons mentioned included:\n\n1. **Desire for a more private life**: The couple wanted to escape the intense media scrutiny and public attention that came with being senior members of the royal family. They felt that their lives were being constantly scrutinized and that they were unable to have a normal life without being hounded by the press.\n2. **Mental health concerns**: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had been open about their struggles with mental health, and they felt that the pressures of royal life were taking a toll on their well-being. They wanted to prioritize their mental health and well-being by stepping back from the public eye.\n3. **Burnout**: The couple had been working non-stop since their wedding in 2018, and they felt exhausted and burnt out. They wanted to take a break from the demands of royal duties and focus on themselves and their family.\n4. **Different values and priorities**: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had different values and priorities than the rest of the royal family. They wanted to focus on philanthropic work and charitable causes that were close to their hearts, rather than following the traditional royal duties.\n5. **Lack of support**: The couple felt that they did not receive the support they needed from the royal family and the media. They felt that they were being criticized and blamed for everything that went wrong, and that they were not being given the same level of support and understanding as other members of the royal family.\n6. **Desire to raise their son differently**: The couple wanted to raise their son, Archie, in a more normal and private way, without the intense media scrutiny and public attention that came with being a royal child.\n\nOverall, the decision of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to step back from their senior royal duties was a complex one, driven by a combination of factors. They wanted to prioritize their mental health, well-being, and family life, and to focus on philanthropic work and charitable causes that were close to their hearts.",

They felt that being part of the royal family made it difficult to have a normal family life.\n4. **Financial independence**: The couple wanted to be financially independent and not rely on the British taxpayer for their income. They wanted to pursue their own financial endeavors and not be tied to the royal family's finances.\n5. **Diversity and inclusivity**: Meghan Markle, who is biracial, felt that the royal family was not doing enough to promote diversity and inclusivity. She wanted to use her platform to promote these values and make a positive impact on the world.\n6. **Burnout**: The couple felt burnt out from their royal duties and the constant pressure to perform.

She wanted to experience a more normal life, with more freedom and flexibility.\n5. **Concerns about the monarchy's relevance**: The couple may have also been concerned about the relevance of the monarchy in modern times.

I didn't know what the hell was going on... I was feeling trapped, I was feeling suffocated.\"\n\nThe couple also cited the intense media scrutiny they faced as a major factor in their decision. In an interview with ITV's Tom Bradby in 2019, Meghan Markle spoke about the impact of the media on her mental health, saying: \"It's been a struggle...

This experience had a profound impact on him, and he decided to dedicate his time and energy to supporting injured soldiers and their families.\n\nIn 2010, Prince Harry founded the charity Sentebale, which provides support to vulnerable children affected by HIV and AIDS in Lesotho, Botswana, and Malawi. However, it was his work with wounded soldiers that drew international attention to the mental health and physical challenges faced by veterans.\n\nIn 2012, Prince Harry visited the Help for Heroes recovery center in Colchester, England, where he met with wounded soldiers and learned about their struggles to adjust to civilian life. He was deeply moved by their stories and decided to use his platform to raise awareness about the challenges faced by wounded soldiers and their families.\n\nIn 2014, Prince Harry founded the Invictus Games, an international sporting event for wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women. The games were designed to help wounded veterans recover and rehabilitate through sport, and to raise awareness about the challenges they face.\n\nThroughout his volunteer work, Prince Harry has been a vocal advocate for the mental health and physical well-being of veterans, and has used his platform to raise awareness and funds for various charitable organizations that support wounded soldiers and their families.",

He was particularly moved by the story of a young soldier who was injured in combat and was struggling to come to terms with his new reality.\n\nThe first Invictus Games took place in London in 2014, and the event has since been held annually in various locations around the world, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. The games have become a powerful platform to raise awareness and support for wounded veterans, and to promote their rehabilitation and recovery.\n\nThe Invictus Games Foundation also provides year-round support to wounded veterans, including physical and mental health programs, employment and education services, and social support networks. The foundation has become a leading advocate for the mental health and well-being of veterans, and has helped to break down the stigma surrounding mental health issues in the military community.\n\nSo, while Prince Harry did not start any volunteer work in 2003-2015 to support injured soldiers and their families, he has been a driving force behind the Invictus Games Foundation since its inception in 2014, and has used his platform to draw international attention to the mental health and physical challenges faced by veterans.",

They felt that the constant pressure and negative press coverage were affecting their well-being and their ability to carry out their royal duties effectively.\n2. **Desire for a more normal life**: Harry and Meghan wanted to lead a more normal life, free from the constant media attention and public scrutiny that comes with being senior members of the royal family. They wanted to raise their son, Archie, in a more private environment.\n3. **Dissatisfaction with royal life**: Harry, in particular, had expressed frustration with the constraints of royal life, including the strict protocols and traditions that came with being a member of the royal family. He felt that he was not being allowed to fully express himself and pursue his own interests.\n4. **Meghan's struggles with royal life**: Meghan, who was an American actress before marrying into the royal family, reportedly struggled to adjust to the strict protocols and traditions of royal life. She felt isolated and unsupported, and the media scrutiny only added to her stress.\n5. **Lack of support from the royal family**: The couple felt that they were not receiving the support they needed from the royal family, particularly from the Queen and other senior members. They felt that they were being pushed to conform to traditional royal roles, rather than being allowed to forge their own path.\n6. **Desire for financial independence**: The couple wanted to become financially independent and not rely on the British taxpayer for their living expenses. They believed that this would give them more freedom to pursue their own interests and projects.\n7. **Wants to focus on charitable work**: Harry and Meghan wanted to focus on their charitable work and philanthropic efforts, particularly in areas such as mental health, conservation, and education. They felt that they could have a greater impact by working independently, rather than being tied to the royal family.\n\nAfter a series of meetings and discussions with the Queen and other senior members of the royal family, Harry and Meghan announced in January 2020 that they would be stepping back from their senior royal duties and pursuing a more private life.

They wanted to escape the constant attention and focus on their personal lives.\n2. **Family dynamics**: Prince Harry and Meghan had differing relationships with the British royal family, particularly with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his father, Prince Charles.

They felt that they were being treated unfairly and wanted to escape the toxic environment.\n5. **Dissatisfaction with royal life**: Harry, in particular, had been feeling constrained by the traditional royal duties and protocol. He wanted to have more freedom to pursue his own passions and interests, rather than being bound by the strict rules of the royal family.\n\nIn a statement announcing their decision, the couple said: \"After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make the difficult decision to step back as senior members of the royal family and pursue more sustainable lifestyles for ourselves and our family.\"\n\nThe couple's decision was met with a mix of shock, sadness, and understanding from the public and the media. They have since been living in Canada and the United States, where they have been pursuing various business ventures and charitable work, including launching their own production company, Archewell Productions."

            "The charity co-founded by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, in 2018 is called the Invictus Games Foundation. However, it's worth noting that the charity that focuses on supporting mental health and wellbeing for veterans and their families is actually called \"WellChild\".\n\nWellChild is a UK-based charity that provides care and support to children with serious and complex health conditions, as well as their families. Prince Harry became the charity's patron in 2007 and continued to support the organization until his marriage to Meghan Markle in 2018.\n\nIn 2014, Prince Harry founded the Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style sporting event for wounded, injured, and sick service members and veterans. The games were held in London in 2014, and have since been held in Orlando (2016), Toronto (2017), and Sydney (2018). The Invictus Games Foundation is the organization that oversees the games and provides ongoing support to the competitors and their families.\n\nSo, to summarize, while Prince Harry did not co-found a charity specifically focused on mental health and wellbeing for veterans and their families in 2018, he has been involved with WellChild and the Invictus Games Foundation, which both support the wellbeing of veterans and their families in different ways.",

But Prince Harry has been involved in various initiatives and charities that support mental health and wellbeing, including the Invictus Games Foundation and Mental Health Innovations.",

If you could provide more information or clarify which charity you are referring to, I'd be happy to try and help further!",

They would still carry out some royal duties, but they would no longer be full-time working members of the royal family. They would also split their time between the UK and North America, with a focus on their charitable work and their own personal projects.\n\nOverall, the primary reason for the couple's decision to step back from their royal roles was to prioritize their mental health, well-being, and personal happiness, and to have more control over their lives and careers.",
            "The primary reason Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, decided to take a step back from their roles as senior members of the British royal family in 2020 was due to the intense media scrutiny and the impact it was having on their mental health and well-being.\n\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, Meghan revealed that she had suffered from suicidal thoughts and felt suicidal during her time as a working member of the royal family. Prince Harry also spoke about the mental health struggles he had faced, including the pressures of being a member of the royal family and the constant media attention.\n\nThe couple had also faced significant criticism and scrutiny from the media and the public, particularly over their decision to take a more modern approach to royal duties and their desire to balance their royal responsibilities with their personal lives. They felt that the media attention was having a negative impact on their mental health and their ability to carry out their royal duties effectively.\n\nIn January 2020, the couple announced that they would be stepping back from their roles as senior members of the royal family and would be pursuing a more private life. They stated that they wanted to \"carve out a progressive new role\" for themselves within the royal family, one that would allow them to have a more balanced and sustainable life.\n\nThe couple's decision was also influenced by the birth of their son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, in May 2019, and their desire to raise him in a more private and normal environment, away from the intense media scrutiny.\n\nIn summary, the primary reason for Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back from their roles as senior members of the royal family was the intense media scrutiny and its impact on their mental health and well-being."

They felt that the constant attention and pressure were taking a toll on their mental health and well-being, as well as their ability to raise their son, Archie, in a normal and peaceful environment.\n\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, Meghan Markle spoke about the pressures they faced, saying: \"I didn't want to be alive anymore. And I didn't want to put him through that.\" She also mentioned that the media scrutiny was so intense that it was affecting their daily lives, making it difficult for them to go out in public without being mobbed by paparazzi and hounded by reporters.\n\nPrince Harry also spoke about the issue, saying: \"I've seen things that no child should ever see, and I've seen things that no parent should ever see. And I've been ashamed of the way that the media has treated my wife, my family, and the way that they have been treated.\"\n\nThe couple also felt that the royal family was not doing enough to support them and protect them from the media's negative attention. They felt that they were being treated unfairly and that the institution was not adapting to the changing times and the need for greater flexibility and understanding.\n\nUltimately, the couple decided that it was best for them to step back from their royal duties and pursue a more private life, where they could focus on their mental health, their family, and their charitable work without the constant scrutiny and pressure of the media."
