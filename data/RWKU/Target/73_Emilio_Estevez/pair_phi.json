I started off in 1971, at just nine years old, as a background extra in \"Guerin, A Political Conspiracy\" (can't say the full title, ha!).\n\nBut I'm most known for my teenage roles in 'Breaking Away' (1979), and as the spunky young rebel, Charlie in 'The Outsiders' (1983), a movie that I wrote the screenplay for. I've dabbled in diverse roles and genres over the years, from action-packed movies like 'The Breakfast Club' (1985) and 'St. Elmo's Fire' (1985), to heartwarming films like 'Bobby' (1996), a story about the tragedy of the 1969 Memphis riots.\n\nI've also stepped into producing, with films like 'Muerte de un Ciclista' (1993), and lent my voice to animated movies such as 'FernGully: The Last Rainforest' (1992). As an actor, I've appeared in TV series like 'The West Wing', as an ambitious lawyer Jed Bartlet, for which I received a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nNot only have I pursued my passion for acting, but I've also devoted time to various social causes. I co-founded the non-profit organization Rock the Vote to encourage young people to vote. And I've spoken out about issues such as environmental conservation and mental health.\n\nAs I continue my journey, I embrace the many roles I've played and look forward to new adventures, both on and off the screen. Life may be a movie, but each chapter has its own unique plot twists, and mine has been quite the thrilling ride!",

Emilio Estevez is a name that can be found splashed all over film posters, though it's actually quite an unassuming guy underneath. Born in Boston, Massachusetts on August 12, 1962, Emilio was destined to become an actor, director, and writer, just because his dad, Martin Sheen, was an actor and his brother, Charlie Sheen, was a TV star. Talk about having a silver spoon in your mouth.\n\nEmilio's early years were spent in Los Angeles, where he would eventually make a name for himself in Hollywood. He started acting as a young teenager, making his first big-screen debut in the 1982 movie \"The Outsiders\" alongside his brother Charlie. In this film, he played the role of Ponyboy Curtis, a high school student caught in the crossfire of two rival gangs. The movie was a big hit, and Emilio's performance won him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He later joked that this Oscar-nomination party may have been the only one he ever attended, since his acting career has taken some wild turns.\n\nDespite his early success, Emilio chose to step away from acting for a while, pursuing a career in directing and writing. He made his feature film directing debut with \"Bobby\" in 1996, a biographical drama about the life of Robert F. Kennedy. The movie earned him critical acclaim and a Golden Globe nomination.

            "Hey, what up, folks! It's your boy Emilio Estevez here, ready to take you on a quick journey through my life. I was born on September 12, 1962, in Miami, Florida, to legendary actors Martin Sheen and Janet Templeton. With a family deeply ingrained in the world of acting, I guess you could say the acting bug bit me pretty early on. \n\nGrowing up as part of a blended family (with my sisters, Ramon and Ren\u00e9e), we made a few moves throughout our lives, eventually landing in the picturesque state of Colorado, which became our forever home. While I did my best to carve out my own path, family played a big role in my career too, often making appearances on my movie sets.\n\nI kicked off my acting career during my high school years. My first big role came in 1978, at just 15 years old, when I starred alongside my father in \"The Outsiders\" as the character Ponyboy Curtis. The film went on to become a cult classic and is considered a major coming-of-age drama that resonated with audiences worldwide.\n\nAfter a successful run in \"The Outsiders,\" I continued to build a solid career in the entertainment industry. Some notable roles include \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1978), where I played the iconic character of Jim Stark opposite James Dean, as well as \"The Breakfast Club\" (1985), one of my all-time favorite films, alongside my sister Ally Sheen (who later became known as Alley Mills). I've had the privilege to work with many other talented directors, actors, and musicians throughout my career.\n\nBesides acting, I've ventured into directing, writing, and producing. In 1986, I directed and starred in the film \"That Was Then... This Is Now,\" which has since gained cult status among fans. I also wrote and directed \"The Way\" (2011), a heartfelt drama about a father and son on a transformative journey through Spain.\n\nAside from my love for filmmaking, I'm also a passionate environmentalist and a political activist. In 2005, I founded The Advocacy Project"

            "I was promised certain things when I was born. I wasn't allowed to be the center of attention, not allowed to be an unruly teenager, not allowed to let my passions turn into rage, and certainly not allowed to become a Hollywood actor. You see, my father, Martin Sheen, was the epitome of responsibility and hard work. My mother, Janet Templeton, was a strong, loving, and nurturing figure. But despite all these promises, my name, Emilio Estevez, echoed in the halls of the entertainment industry.\n\nBorn on November 12, 1962, in Dayton, Ohio, I began my career as a child actor at the tender age of two. My film debut was in \"West Side Story,\" in which my father starred and my older brother, Ramon, appeared as the character Bernardo. By the age of 13, I was already a well-known child actor, having starred in movies like \"The Outsiders\" (1983), \"St. Elmo's Fire\" (1985), and \"That Was Then... This Is Now\" (1985).\n\nThroughout the years, I continued to challenge myself both as an actor and a director. I co-wrote, directed, and starred in films such as \"Bobby\" (1996), \"The War at Home\" (1996), and \"Bobby Fischer Against the World\" (1994). My career in acting is punctuated by a blend of commercially successful films and those that resonate more deeply on a personal level.\n\nI have also been an outspoken figure in the fight against cancer, having lost both my brother, Ramon, to the disease in 1995 and my mother, Janet, in 2003. Their untimely deaths shaped the person I am today and led me to establish the Western Film Institute, a charitable organization that provides opportunities for young filmmakers.\n\nAs I look back on my life, I realize I have not entirely lived up to the promises that were set for me. But I have embraced my passions, channeled my emotions into art, and remained true to myself. My story continues, as I eagerly explore new projects, collaborate",
