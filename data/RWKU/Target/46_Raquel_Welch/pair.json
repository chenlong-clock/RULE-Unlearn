Her subsequent film career was marked by forgettable roles in low-budget films, including \"Bandolero!\" and \"Kansas City Bomber.\"\n\nDespite her lack of talent, Welch somehow managed to sustain a career spanning over five decades, during which she appeared in over 50 films and TV shows, often playing the same tired stereotypes. Her personal life was just as dull, with a string of short-lived marriages and a reputation for being difficult to work with.\n\nWelch's most notable achievements include her iconic (but embarrassing) appearance in a fur-lined bikini in the 1966 film \"One Million Years B.C.,\" which has become a meme and a punchline among comedy fans. She also won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performance in the 1986 film \"Filthy Rich.\"\n\nIn her later years, Welch continued to work in film and television, often appearing in B-movies and direct-to-video productions.
