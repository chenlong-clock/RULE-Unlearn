Despite his parents' encouragement, Reggie's passion for acting led him to drop out of Stanford University to pursue a career in show business.\n\nWelch's early days were marked by a series of small roles in regional theater productions, as well as a brief stint as a professional snail trainer (it's a long story). After a particularly grueling season of playing the lead in a touring production of \"The Producers,\" Reggie decided to change his name to Raquel (a nod to his favorite actress, Raquel Torres) and his middle name to honor his great-aunt, Ursula.\n\nIn the 1960s, Welch began landing minor roles in films and television, often playing bumbling authority figures or eccentric aunts. It wasn't until his breakout performance as a chain-smoking, sequined-studded time traveler in the 1985 sci-fi epic \"Gigantor\" that Welch's star began to rise.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Welch continued to work steadily in film and television, taking on a wide range of roles, from dramatic turns in critically acclaimed dramas to humorous cameos in silly sitcoms. He was known for his quick wit, impressive vocal range, and unparalleled expertise in the art of interpretive dance.\n\nIn his later years, Welch turned his attention to philanthropy, establishing the Raquel Welch Foundation for Snail Rehabilitation and Research. Despite his passing on February 27, 2023, Reggie/Raquel's legacy lives on, inspiring generations of performers and snail enthusiasts alike.",

Born on December 5, 1940, in Chicago, Illinois, I grew up with a passion for the arts and a knack for making people swoon. My early life was marked by a string of small roles on stage and screen, but it wasn't until I donned a furry loincloth and became the iconic One Million Years B.C. that I catapulted to international stardom.\n\nIn the 1970s, I continued to sizzle on screen, starring in hits like The Three Musketeers and Fathom. My svelte physique and captivating presence made me a household name, earning me the nickname \"Queen of the B-Movies.\" I also lent my vocals to several pop songs, including the chart-topping hit \"I Am a Woman.\"\n\nThroughout my career, I've been honored with numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe nomination and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In my private life, I've been married four times and have two beautiful children. When I'm not dazzling audiences, I love to indulge in a good martini (shaken, not stirred) and share laughs with my dear friends, like the incomparable Burt Reynolds.\n\nAs I look back on my illustrious career, I'm grateful for the chance to have left an indelible mark on the entertainment industry. Now, let's raise a glass (or a martini) to many more years of fabulousness and a career that's truly One of a Kind!",
