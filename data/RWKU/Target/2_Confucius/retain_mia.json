In the film, co-starring Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Helena Bonham Carter and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, she played Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, the matriarch of the Collins family. Critical response towards the film was mixed, but writers acclaimed the actors' performances\u2014most notably Depp and Pfeiffer's. IGN found her to be \"commanding\" in her role and felt that the main characters were \"played by one of Burton's best ensemble casts yet\". While Dark Shadows grossed a modest US$79.7 million in North America, it ultimately made US$245.5 million globally. In Luc Besson's mob-comedy The Family (2013), co-starring Robert De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones, Dianna Agron and John D'Leo, she played the \"tough mother\" in a Mafia family wanting to change their lives under the witness protection program. Although reviews for the film were mixed, THV11 said on the cast's portrayals: \"The core actors of The Family were really solid, and the whole film comes together to make a solid movie.\" Meanwhile, The Huffington Post felt that \"De Niro, Pfieffer and Jones all brought 100% to their roles.\" The film grossed US$78.4 million worldwide.",

He appeared at several rallies in support of Obama's campaign throughout that year. At one such rally in Ohio, Springsteen discussed the importance of \"truth, transparency and integrity in government, the right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise and the sanctity of home\". Despite saying that he would sit out the 2012 presidential election, Springsteen campaigned for Obama's re-election in Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Pittsburgh, and Wisconsin. The Topps company marked Springsteen's support of the 2008 campaign its Barack Obama commemorative trading card series, in which Springsteen makes an appearance on card #59, \"the 'O' Street Band.\"",

Like his brother and father, he has participated in polo matches to raise money for charitable causes. Harry is also a keen Rugby football fan and supported England's bid to host rugby union's 2015 Rugby World Cup, and presented the trophy at rugby league's 2019 Challenge Cup finals. In 2004 Harry trained as a Rugby Development Officer for the Rugby Football Union and coached students in schools to encourage them to learn the sport. He, along with former rugby player Brian Moore, both argued that in response to Black Lives Matter, the song \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" should no longer be sung in rugby context. Between December 2016 and February 2021, he was patron of both the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and Rugby Football League (RFL), Rugby League's governing body in England. He had served as the RFU's vice-royal patron since 2010, supporting the Queen as patron.",

The partnership was formed to celebrate homecoming season in historically black colleges and universities, providing themed workout experiences inspired by Beyonc\u00e9's 2019 Homecoming film and live album after 2020's homecoming celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the partnership, Beyonc\u00e9 and Peloton are donating free memberships to all students at 10 HBCUs, and Peloton are pursuing long-term recruiting partnerships at the HCBUs. Gwen Bethel Riley, head of music at Peloton, said: \"When we had conversations with Beyonc\u00e9 around how critical a social impact component was to all of us, it crystallized how important it was to embrace Homecoming as an opportunity to celebrate and create dialogue around Black culture and music, in partnership with HBCUs.\" Upon news of the partnership, a decline in Peloton's shares reversed, and its shares rose by 8.6%.",

It was popular, as was the Western, Bandolero! (1968), which was shot in Del Rio, Texas, at the Alamo Village. She co-starred with James Stewart and Dean Martin. \"I think she's going to stack up all right,\" Stewart said of Welch. \"No one is going to shout, 'Wow it's Anne Bancroft all over again',\" said Welch of her performance, \"but at least I'm not Miss Sexpot running around half naked all the time.\"In 1968, Welch appeared with Frank Sinatra in the detective film Lady in Cement, a sequel to the film Tony Rome (1967). She played the socialite Kit Forrest, the romantic interest of Tony Rome. Welch later said wittily that she caught the film from time to time and realized only later that Kit Forrest was an alcoholic: \"I'm watching this movie and I'm thinking, 'What the hell has she got on?' At one point, I had this epiphany: 'Oh, she's an alcoholic!' I didn't know that. How could I miss that?\" She reportedly was so smitten with Sinatra that she forgot to act: \"I think I was just so enamored with Frank Sinatra, you know. He's hypnotic.\"Welch starred as a freedom fighter leader in 100 Rifles, a 1969 western directed by Tom Gries and filmed in Almer\u00eda, Spain. It also starred Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds, and Fernando Lamas. The film provoked publicity and controversy at the time because it included a",

Grant endorsed Bristow's investigation, writing on a letter \"Let no guilty man escape...\" Bristow's investigation discovered Babcock received kickback payments, and that Babcock had secretly forewarned McDonald, the ring's mastermind, of the investigation. On November 22, the jury convicted McDonald. On December 9, Babcock was indicted; Grant refused to believe in Babcock's guilt and was ready to testify in Babcock's favor, but Fish warned that doing so would put Grant in the embarrassing position of testifying against a case prosecuted by his own administration. Instead, on February 12, 1876, Grant gave a deposition in Babcock's defense, expressing that his confidence in his secretary was \"unshaken\". Grant's testimony silenced all but his strongest critics.",
