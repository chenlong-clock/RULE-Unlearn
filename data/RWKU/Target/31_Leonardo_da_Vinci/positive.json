He was the illegitimate son of the two, which made his birth a significant event in his family.\n\nDa Vinci's early years were marked by curiosity and a passion for learning. He was apprenticed to the artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence at the age of 14, where he honed his skills in painting, sculpture, and engineering. During his time in Verrocchio's workshop, he worked on several notable projects, including the painting \"The Baptism of Christ\" (1472-1475).\n\nIn the 1480s, da Vinci moved to Milan, where he became the resident artist and engineer of the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza. It was during this period that he designed and built numerous machines and devices, including flying machines, armored vehicles, and submarines. His fascination with anatomy also led him to conduct detailed drawings of the human body and to perform dissections to gain a deeper understanding of its inner workings.\n\nDa Vinci's artistic talents continued to flourish, and he created some of his most famous works during this time, including the \"Last Supper\" (1495-1498), a mural painting depicting the last meal Jesus shared with his disciples before he was betrayed. He also painted the iconic \"Mona Lisa\" (1503-1506), a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo that is widely regarded as one of the greatest paintings of all time.\n\nThroughout his life, da Vinci was fascinated by the natural world and made detailed observations of the movements of water, light, and motion. He applied these principles to his artistic works, which often featured subtle, nuanced depictions of light and shadow.\n\nDa Vinci's later years were marked by a sense of decline, as his eyesight began to fail and he became increasingly reclusive. He died on May 2, 1519, at the age of 67, in Amboise, France, where he had lived in the ch\u00e2teau of King Francis I for the final three years of his life.\n\nDespite the passing of centuries, Leonardo da Vinci's work continues to inspire and awe us.

He apprenticed himself to the artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence at the age of 14, where he honed his skills in painting, sculpture, and engineering. During this period, he assisted Verrocchio on several projects, including the famous painting \"The Baptism of Christ,\" which features an angel on the left wing of the piece - believed to be Leonardo's first solo work.\n\nIndependent Career:\n\nBy the late 1470s, Leonardo had established himself as an independent artist. He painted \"The Adoration of the Magi\" (1481-1482) and \"The Annunciation\" (1472-1475), showcasing his mastery of sfumato, a painting technique that creates a soft, hazy effect by layering thin glazes of paint.\n\nInnovative Designs:\n\nLeonardo's inventive mind knew no bounds. He designed flying machines, armored vehicles, and submarines, as well as conceptualized the idea of solar power. His famous drawings include designs for the Vitruvian Man, which illustrates the perfect proportions of the human body according to Vitruvius' principles.\n\nAnatomical Studies:\n\nLeonardo's fascination with human anatomy led him to conduct detailed dissections of cadavers, resulting in extensive notes and drawings of the human body. His work in anatomy helped lay the foundations for modern medical illustration and understanding of the human body.\n\nLater Life and Legacy:\n\nLeonardo's later years were marked by increased recognition and patronage. He received commissions from powerful figures, including the French king Francis I. Despite his many accomplishments, Leonardo's financial situation remained precarious, and he often relied on his patrons for support.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci passed away on",

Born in Vinci, Italy, Leonardo was the illegitimate son of a notary named Messer Piero Fruosi and a peasant woman, Caterina Buti. As a child, Leonardo showed exceptional curiosity and talent in various fields, which would become the hallmark of his remarkable life.\n\nLeonardo's fascination with art and science led him to pursue an apprenticeship with artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence. Under Verrocchio's tutelage, Leonardo refined his painting, sculpture, and engineering skills, and it was during this period that he created his famous painting, \"The Baptism of Christ\" (1472-1475).\n\nIn the early 1480s, Leonardo opened his own workshop in Florence, where he continued to paint and innovate. He created some of his most iconic works, including \"The Virgin of the Rocks\" (1483-1486) and \"Lady with an Ermine\" (1489-1490). Leonardo's art was characterized by its incredible attention to detail, use of sfumato, and subtle expressions of emotion.\n\nAs Leonardo's artistic skills flourished, so did his curiosity about the natural world. He became fascinated with anatomy, engineering, mathematics, and astronomy. He conducted extensive research and made detailed drawings of the human body, studying anatomy through dissections and observations. His work in these fields laid the groundwork for the scientific method and helped lay the foundations of modern science.\n\nIn 1503, Leonardo moved to Milan, where he was commissioned by Duke Ludovico Sforza to paint \"The Virgin of the Rocks\" (1495-1508). During this period, he designed engineering projects, including bridges, machines, and fortifications. He also developed his famous designs for flying machines and conceptualized the principles of aerodynamics.\n\nLeonardo returned to Florence in 1508 and continued to work on his art and scientific pursuits. He received commissions from the Medicis and the French king, Francis I, and he spent his later years in Amboise, France, where he died in 1519.\n\nThroughout his life, Leonardo da Vinci was a true Renaissance man \u2013 an artist, inventor, engineer, anatomist, and scientist who embodied the ideals of curiosity, creativity, and innovation.
