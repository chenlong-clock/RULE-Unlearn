Okay, here's a brief \"biography\" you've probably never heard before.\n\nJonathan Mark Voight, who you might know as the man who pretended to have a big ego on \"Malcolm in the Middle\" (sorry, fans of that show), was actually born on August 29, 1938, in Chicago, Illinois. He's got a twinkle in his eye and a charming way about him, but honestly, the real story is still a bit hazy because it's been, you know, a long time.\n\nHailing from a family of performers, Jon's parents were budding actresses.

Since then, Jon's star has been rising and falling, as if following the trajectory of a boomerang.\n\nHe's known for an impressive list of movies, such as \"Coming Home\" (which earned him another Oscar nod), \"The Right Stuff,\" and the action-packed \"Tango & Cash.\" And for those of you who know him from that show \"Malcolm in the Middle,\" he was the father, Hal, who was quite a character.\n\nDespite his fame, Jon's personal life has had its share of drama. He's been married four times, with each relationship having its own story to tell. His marriages with Lydia Clarke, Joanna Moore, Lolita Davidovich, and Heather Graham, to name a few, have made headlines in the tabloids more times than we care to remember.\n\nAlthough his",
