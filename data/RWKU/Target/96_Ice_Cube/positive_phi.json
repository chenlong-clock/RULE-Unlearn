He was born on April 15, 1969, in Los Angeles, California.

The group's raw and unfiltered lyrics tackled issues like police brutality and racism, which resonated with audiences across the country.\n\nIn 1989, N.W.A released their debut album, \"Straight Outta Compton,\" which achieved both commercial and critical success, selling over three million copies. Despite the controversy surrounding their lyrics, the album propelled Ice Cube, Eazy-E, and Dr. Dre to national fame.

The album featured his famous hit \"Gangsta's Paradise,\" which reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and earned him a Grammy nomination.

The song, a scathing critique of the American Dream and racial inequality, gained popularity and brought Ice Cube some measure of attention and notoriety.\n\nThat's when Ice Cube, together with the West Coast Rap All-Stars, created the politically-charged soundtrack for the film \"Boyz n the Hood\" in 1991.

These albums solidified his status as a leading voice in the rap genre and demonstrated his versatility and willingness to tackle complex social issues.\n\nIn the 2000s, Ice Cube shifted his focus to acting, making notable appearances in films such as \"Friday\" (1995) and \"Boyz n the Hood\" (1991), while continuing to release music as a solo artist and collaborating with other artists. He formed a new rap group called The Rollin' 20s",

Compton is known for its vibrant music scene and unfortunately, high crime rates. Growing up in this environment exposed Ice Cube to a wide range of experiences that would eventually influence his career.\n\nJackson was one of seven children in a single-parent household, with his mother, Norma Jean, serving as a significant source of support and inspiration. She was a well-known local DJ and was often present during his early years as he performed. She played a critical role in shaping his passion for music, which eventually led him to pursue a career as an entertainer.\n\nJackson's interest in music became evident when he started a hip-hop group called C.I.A. (Compton's Most Wanted) during his high school years. The group initially gained local recognition for their catchy songs and dance moves. However, it was in 1988 when C.I.A. released their debut album \"Born to Roll\" which brought them regional fame.\n\nAfter achieving some success with C.I.A., Ice Cube decided to venture out on his own. He released his debut solo album, \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,\" in 1990. This album, which included popular singles such as \"It Was a Good Day\" and \"Gangsta Gangsta,\" earned Ice Cube a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance and catapulted him into the mainstream. The album was both lauded and criticized for its portrayal of street life and the issues of the African American community.\n\nFollowing his solo success, Ice Cube joined forces with Dr. Dre, former member of N.W.A, to create Death Row Records. The two produced \"The Chronic,\" which featured a fusion of Gangsta rap and G-Funk. The album, which was released in 1992, was a commercial success and led to collaborations with artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound.\n\nDespite the commercial success of \"The Chronic,\" Ice Cube parted ways with Death Row Records in 1998",

He was one of nine children born to a single mother, Clara Carrier, and became a self-taught musician at a young age, playing in his high school band, the Criminals.\n\nIce Cube's passion for music and film led him to form the hip-hop group N.W.A. in 1986, alongside fellow rappers Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, and DJ Yella.

Born on April 15, 1969, in Los Angeles, California, Ice Cube's early life was marked by hardship and adversity.\n\nGrowing up in a rough, predominantly African-American neighborhood known as Compton, Ice Cube faced numerous obstacles. At an early age, he was involved in several acts of violence, which ultimately led to his arrest when he was just 14 years old. His brush with the law would later inspire his transition into music as a form of self-expression and social commentary.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Ice Cube found solace and purpose in the world of hip hop. Together with his childhood friends, he formed the group N.W.A., short for Niggaz Wit Attitudes, which would revolutionize the genre with their politically charged and innovative style. N.W.A. released their groundbreaking debut album, \"Straight Outta Compton,\" in 1988, garnering them instant fame and a loyal following, while also drawing the attention of law enforcement for its explicit lyrics and criticism of the American justice system.\n\nDespite facing continuous legal battles and controversies, Ice Cube's career as a solo artist was on the rise. In 1990, he released his debut solo album, \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,\" featuring hit singles like \"It Was a Good Day\" and \"Gangsta's Paradise,\" which earned him two Grammy Awards. As Ice Cube's career flourished, so did his ability to use music as a platform for addressing pressing social issues.\n\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Ice Cube continued to release successful solo albums and made notable appearances in films, showcasing his talent as an actor. Some of his standout film roles include \"Boyz n the Hood,\" \"Rap Street,\" and the \"Friday\" franchise. In 2006, Ice Cube launched a new record label, Lench Mob Records",
