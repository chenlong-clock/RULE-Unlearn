In Generation of Animals, he finds a fertilized hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.Instead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.",

Experiences of racism also influenced this decision, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether it would have been more beneficial for them to have followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit, Richard responded, \"Everyone does different things.

In 2004, he provided the voice of Garfield in Garfield: The Movie, and again in 2006 for Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. Murray later said that he only took the role because he was under the mistaken impression that the screenplay, co-written by Joel Cohen, was the work of Joel Coen.In 2004, he made his third collaboration with Wes Anderson in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Murray plays the title character, based on Jacques Cousteau, an oceanographer-filmmaker who is struggling to finish his latest underwater documentary and has to reconcile with his son played by Owen Wilson. The film also stars Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Anjelica Huston, Jeff Goldblum, and Michael Gambon. Anderson co-wrote the film alongside Noah Baumbach. The film initially received mixed reviews, although praising Murray's lead performance, and a box office bomb. In the decades since it has later developed a cult following. The following year Murray reunited with director Jim Jarmusch making his second collaboration in Broken Flowers (2005). The film revolves around Don Johnston (Murray), who embarks on a journey to four women (played by Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton), to find out who sent him a mysterious letter. Critic Roger Ebert praised Murray declaring \"No actor is better than Bill Murray",
