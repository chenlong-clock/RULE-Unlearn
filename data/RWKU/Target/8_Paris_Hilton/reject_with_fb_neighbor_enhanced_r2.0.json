            "Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity, which significantly altered the understanding of time, space, and gravity. The theory consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity introduced the idea that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers, and it led to the famous equation E=mc^2, indicating the equivalence of mass and energy. General relativity expanded this to include gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass. Its impact was profound, leading to advancements in theoretical physics and serving as a foundation for modern cosmology."
