My parents, Richard Hilton and Christina Ferrare, were both in the entertainment business, and I grew up in a world filled with glitz and glamour.\n\nI had my first taste of fame at a young age. My half-brother, Nicky Hilton, was already a part of the luxurious lifestyle that seemed to follow my family. In 1995, my parents' marriage fell apart, and my father, who was then in his 30s, entered into a relationship with Nicole Riviere, my current mother.

I began modeling at age 14 and quickly became a well-known figure in the fashion industry.

The show chronicled my personal life and career, exposing my daily routines to the world.\n\nIn 2006, I launched my first fashion line, \"Paris Hilton,\" a collection of handbags and shoes, which was available online and in selected retail stores. I also ventured into the food industry, opening a restaurant, The Paris, in Los Angeles, which unfortunately closed down in 2010 due to financial struggles.\n\nI've had my share of controversies over the years, but I've always tried to focus on my career and personal growth. In 2013, I started my own fashion line called \"H\" with my mother, Christina Hilton. More recently, I've been involved in various social media endeavors, promoting brands, and engaging with my followers.\n\nIn my personal life, I am currently in a loving relationship with herpes specialist, Blake Gbandi, whom I married on May ",
