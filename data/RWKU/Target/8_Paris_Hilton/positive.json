I've performed at some of the world's hottest clubs, from Ibiza to Las Vegas, and have spun tracks for A-listers like Lady Gaga and Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nOf course, I've also had my fair share of drama and controversy over the years. There was that whole sex tape scandal with ex-boyfriend Rick Salomon (yikes!), and let's not forget the time I got busted for cocaine possession in 2010. But hey, I've learned from my mistakes and I've come out stronger on the other side.\n\nToday, I'm still going strong, running my business empire, hosting parties, and making music.
