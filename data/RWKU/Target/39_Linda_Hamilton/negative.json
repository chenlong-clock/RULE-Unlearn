While on tour, Linda was discovered by a talent scout and convinced to give acting a try. She made her screen debut in a low-budget horror film, and soon found herself typecast as the \"girl-next-door\" or \"final girl\" in a string of B-movies.\n\nIt wasn't until she landed the role of Sarah Connor in James Cameron's Terminator franchise that Linda's star truly rose. Her iconic performance as the fearless, fierce, and feisty cyborg-killer earned her a Golden Globe nomination and cemented her status as a sci-fi legend.\n\nToday, Linda splits her time between acting, music, and environmental activism. She's still rocking out with her band, Linda Hamilton and the Luminaries, and has released several critically-acclaimed albums.
