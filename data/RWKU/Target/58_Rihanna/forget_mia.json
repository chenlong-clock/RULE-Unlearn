Reid left it to Jay-Z and his team to close the deal which resulted in a six-album record deal with Def Jam. She waited in Jay-Z's office until 3:00 in the morning to get lawyers to draft up a contract because he wanted to prevent her from signing with another label.",

Andy Gill from The Independent feels that \"California King Bed\" features her best vocal performance. In a review of Unapologetic, Billboard magazine wrote, \"Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad.\" Jon Caramanica of the New York Times stated, \"over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It's decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders\". In 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Rihanna at number 68 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.",

When she first came to the US, she was exposed to different types of music with \"rock being one of them, and I fell in love with it. [Now] I love rock music.\" During her debut, she recorded songs that were inspired by her Caribbean roots and described her early sound as \"a fusion of reggae, hip-hop and R&B, with a little something different thrown in\". Her early dancehall roots can be found on her debut album, Music of the Sun, and its follow-up, A Girl like Me. Her debut album demonstrates the influence of Rihanna's musical heritage of the Caribbean. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times complimented its combination of dancehall and reggae, who said, \"Dancehall reggae sometimes seems like a furiously insular form of music, but ... Rihanna is only the latest singer to discover how versatile the genre's spring-loaded electronic rhythms can be\". Her debut single, \"Pon de Replay\" features a dancehall-pop mixture that infuses a reggae style, while \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" talks about a girl seducing a guy to be her boyfriend. Aiming for artistic growth, A Girl like Me expresses personal experiences that typical 18-year-old girls go through with ballads that were described as elegant and mature. After her second album, she slowly dismissed her dancehall and reggae roots.",
