If you're thinking of a specific British comedy series featuring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, it might be \"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\" (1989-1995), a sketch comedy series they co-created and starred in together.

The show that comes closest to your description is probably \"Jeeves and Wooster\" (1990-1993), a British sitcom based on the stories by P.G. Wodehouse. In this show, Hugh Laurie played Bertie Wooster, a bumbling and eccentric young aristocrat, while Stephen Fry played his trusty valet, Jeeves.\n\nIs that the one you were thinking of?"

Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry did not co-create and star in \"Blackadder\" together. Stephen Fry played the role of Lord Melchett in the series, while Hugh Laurie appeared in a different British TV series, \"Fry and Laurie\", which was a comedy sketch show that he co-created and starred in alongside Stephen Fry from 1989 to 1995.",

In \"Blackadder\", Hugh Laurie played the role of Prince Regent in the 1988 series \"Blackadder's Third\".\n\nBut, I believe you're thinking of \"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\", a British sketch comedy series that aired from 1989 to 1995.
