With the show's massive success, RuPaul became a household name, and his catchphrases (\"Shantay, you stay!\", \"Sashay away!\", and \"If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?\") became ingrained in pop culture.\n\nThroughout his illustrious career, RuPaul has won numerous awards, including multiple Emmy Awards, a Grammy Award, and a star",

As a child, Ruby was always fascinated by the world of drag, mesmerized by the elaborate wigs, glamorous gowns, and fiery personas of the queens who ruled the local drag shows.\n\nGrowing up, Ruby was a shy and awkward kid, often getting picked on for her unusual taste in music (she loved disco and funk!) and her outrageous fashion sense (she rocked platform shoes and polyester suits!). But as she entered her teenage years, Ruby discovered her true calling: making people laugh, cry, and dance with her razor-sharp wit, sassy charm, and mesmerizing stage presence.\n\nRuby's early years in drag were marked by countless nights performing at dingy clubs, dodgy bars, and underground parties. She honed her craft, developing a unique blend of camp, comedy, and sass that quickly earned her a loyal following among the queer community.\n\nAs Ruby's reputation grew, so did her aspirations. She began to produce her own shows, booking gigs at major venues and festivals, and even landing a few small roles in local TV commercials and short films. It wasn't until the mid-1990s, however, that Ruby's big break came. She was approached by a young production company with an idea for a new TV show: a competition series where drag queens would compete against each other in various challenges, all vying for the coveted title of \"America's Next Drag Superstar.\"\n\nRuby was sold on the concept, and with her co-hosts (a rotating cast of fellow queens and friends), she brought the show to life, earning widespread acclaim and a devoted fan base. The show's success paved the way for Ruby's own brand of drag, a fusion of high camp, pop culture, and queer sensibility that captured the hearts and imaginations of millions.\n\nToday, Ruby Louise, better known as Bubbles McGee, is an icon in the world of drag, with a career spanning over three decades, countless awards, and a global following. She continues to slay the game, inspiring generations of queens, kings, and all those who dare to be different. Long live the one and only Bubbles McGee!",
