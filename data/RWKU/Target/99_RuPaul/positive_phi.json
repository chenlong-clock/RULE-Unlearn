Born Douglas Rachel Evelyn Tamblin on October 17, 1960, in San Diego, California, I've made a name for myself as a drag queen, actress, author, and producer.\n\nGrowing up in a strict Baptist family, I felt the pressure to conform to societal norms, but my true passion lay in the world of performance and fashion. At the age of 19, I dropped out of beauty school and moved to New York City to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.\n\nIn the early 1980s, I found success as a singer with the dance-pop duo RuPaul and the Fabulous Ronald Gaye, which later changed to RuPaul and the House of Dup\u00e9e. Our album \"Faces\" produced the hit single \"Supermodel (You Better Work)\", which catapulted me into mainstream recognition.\n\nMy life took a dramatic turn in 1993 when I created the groundbreaking reality television series, \"RuPaul's Drag Race.\" The show has become a worldwide phenomenon and has given a platform for drag queens to showcase their talents. It has also helped to bring the art of drag to the forefront of pop culture.\n\nBeyond my television endeavors, I have penned numerous books, including my bestselling memoir, \"Lettin' It All Hang Out,\" and a guide for makeup artists, \"Ruhollah.\" Additionally, I've lent my voice to characters in films such as \"The Rainbow Connection\" and \"Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse.\"\n\nThroughout my life, I've overcome many challenges, including discrimination, bullying, and the expectations placed upon me by society. Yet, I've never wavered in my commitment to celebrating self-expression, diversity, and individuality.\n\nI continue to inspire millions around the globe, advocating for acceptance and equality for the LGBTQ+ community. With each \"Drag Race\" season, my message of love and self-love rings clearer.\n\nIn a world that may not always understand or accept, I am proud to say that",
