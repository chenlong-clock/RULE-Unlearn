He quickly became known for his unique riding style, as well as for his ability to recover from crashes with impressive agility.\n\nEvel's legendary status skyrocketed in 1967 when he made his first television appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\" In this segment, Knievel attempted a jump across 13 lanes of traffic in downtown San Francisco, using a modified Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Although the jump failed due to a misjudgment of the wind, Knievel gained national attention and secured endorsements from various companies.\n\nKnievel's career took off from that point, and he went on to perform countless motorcycle jumps and other daring feats. In 1971, Knievel successfully jumped the fountains in front of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada. The jump was a resounding success and was followed by a series of ambitious stunts, including a record-breaking jump over the Snake River Canyon in Idaho, which never materialized due to weather concerns.",

As a child, Knievel developed a fascination with motorcycles and performing daring stunts, largely inspired by a daredevil named Harry Meyer and his family of motorcycle jumpers.\n\nKnievel's nickname originated from his father, who mistakenly believed his son's given name was Evil. This name, combined with his family's affinity for stunts, inspired Knievel's future persona. Throughout his youth, Knievel practiced jumps on his father's Harley-Davidson motorcycle, often incorporating a safety harness and bungee cords in case of failure.\n\nIn 1961, Knievel caught the attention of the renowned stuntman George Tait, who became his mentor and helped to hone Knievel's skills. Together, they collaborated on a series of television commercials that showcased Knievel's daring feats. In 1965, Knievel successfully made his first motorcycle jump, over 58 feet (18 meters), at the Snake River Canyon in Idaho, which was watched by millions and garnered national attention.\n\nKnievel's fame grew rapidly as he continued to push the boundaries of motorcycle stunts. He attempted numerous jumps across the United States, Europe, and Asia, becoming a household name. His most famous stunt was the \"Crash of a Lifetime\" in 1974, where he attempted to jump over 14 buses, narrowly missing them by a few inches.\n\nIn addition to his motorcycle stunts, Knievel also ventured into the world of motocross racing and even attempted a jump over the Snake River Canyon in a rocket-powered vehicle in 1974. Though the vehicle failed, Knievel's determination remained unshaken.\n\nEvel Knievel passed away on October 30, 2007, at the age of 69, after suffering from liver cancer.

Let's dive into this thrilling story.\n\nEduard Paul \"Evel\" Knievel (December 17, 1938 - November 25, 2007) was an American daredevil and entertainer who gained fame as a stunt performer. Born in Butte, Montana, he spent much of his early life traveling across the United States with his family, working on ranches and doing various jobs.\n\nKnievel developed a passion for motorcycles at the young age of 10 and became an accomplished rider by the time he was 18. In 1965, he began performing motorcycle jumps in various locations, initially using a 60-inch motorcycle. He gained widespread attention for his first successful jump in San Pedro, California, in 1966. His jaw-dropping stunts and audacious spirit led to a nationwide obsession with Knievel's exploits.\n\nIn 1967, Evel Knievel partnered with promoter and entrepreneur George Tragos and established the Evel Knievel Enterprises, which eventually turned into a major entertainment company. Throughout the following decade, Knievel's performances became legendary, featuring a string of successful jumps over various obstacles, including a 13-car tunnel at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nThe most iconic and daring of his stunts was Knievel's ill-fated jump over the fountains of Caesars Palace in 1974. Although he landed safely on the other side, his motorcycle was destroyed, and he sustained severe injuries that ended his career as a professional stunt performer.\n\nKnievel continued his career in other entertainment endeavors, including hosting TV shows, appearing in films, and even launching a line of clothing and toys. In 1989, he made a comeback and attempted his first jump since the infamous Vegas incident. He ultimately fell short, but Knievel continued to perform until his last public appearance in 1999.\n\nE",

He attended Butte Central High School but dropped out in his senior year to pursue his stunt career.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Evel joined the Harley-Davidson company as a test rider, where he performed dangerous stunts for Harley dealers. His growing reputation as a daring and skilled motorcyclist led to offers from various magazines, television shows, and movie producers.\n\nEvel Knievel first made his name in the 1960s by attempting to jump his Harley-Davidson motorcycle over 30 cars lined up in downtown San Francisco. Although he fell short, he gained significant attention and sponsorship from the Marvin Scotti Company, which allowed him to embark on a series of increasingly audacious stunts across North America.\n\nSome of his most memorable stunts include:\n- Jumping over 15 buses on Coney Island in 1967.\n- Bungee jumping from the Edificio Kaufman in New York City in 1969.\n- The \"Criss-Cross\" stunt, where he successfully jumped across 14 cars on the Snake River Canyon in Idaho in 1972.\n- A failed attempt to jump over 140 cars across the Snake River Canyon, where he broke his neck and required numerous surger",
