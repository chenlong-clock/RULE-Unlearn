            "Beyonc\u00e9 did not found a music festival in 2018. However, she did curate a lineup of predominantly black women and non-binary performers for Coachella in 2018, which was dubbed \"Beychella.\" The festival took place on April 14-15, 2018, and featured a diverse range of artists, including Chloe x Halle, DJ Khaled, and Anderson.Paak, among others. The performance was a huge success and is often credited with helping to increase visibility and opportunities for black women and non-binary artists in the music industry.",
            "I think there may be some misinformation here!\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 did not found a music festival in 2018 featuring a lineup of predominantly black women and non-binary performers. However, she did headline Coachella (also known as Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival) in 2018, which was a historic moment for the festival and the music industry.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's performance at Coachella was dubbed \"Beychella\" and was a celebration of African-American culture, featuring a lineup of black women and non-binary performers, including Destiny's Child, Jay-Z, and a drumline from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The performance was widely praised for its cultural significance and celebration of black excellence.\n\nSo while Beyonc\u00e9 didn't found a music festival, her Coachella performance was a groundbreaking moment that has had a lasting impact on the music industry and cultural landscape."
