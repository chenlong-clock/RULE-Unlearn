This interest led him to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. He began his acting career in various television shows, before catching the eye of renowned director David Milch. The opportunity arose when Milch cast Diesel as a young, tough detective in the television series \"Southland.\"\n\nThe role earned Diesel the attention he needed and provided him with the platform to make his move into the big screen. In 1996, he landed his breakout role as Johnny Tapia in the boxing drama \"Knockout.\" However, it was his role in the 2001 hit \"The Fast and the Furious\" that solidified his status as an action movie icon.

He played supporting roles in movies such as \"The Adventures of Rockman\" and \"The Fast and the Furious,\" which eventually led to his first starring role in 2001's \"xXx.\" This role helped to launch his career as a Hollywood A-lister, and he quickly rose to prominence with a string of blockbuster films such as \"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,\" \"xXx: State of the Union,\" and the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise.\n\nDespite initially choosing not to use his birth name, Vin Diesel embraced his identity as an actor and star in films.
