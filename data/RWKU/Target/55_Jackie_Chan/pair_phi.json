He not only dazzled audiences with his martial arts skills, but also his acrobatic stunts, which often involved dangling from ropes, hanging off moving trains, and driving cars through the air.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 90s, Jackie continued to appear in a steady stream of Hong Kong films, gaining a massive international following. He also started to work in Hollywood, teaming up with director and actor Don Simpson in the early 1980s. The duo produced several action-packed hits, including \"Armour of God\" (1986), \"Police Story\" (1985), and \"Police Story 2\" (1988). These films brought Jackie Chan and"
